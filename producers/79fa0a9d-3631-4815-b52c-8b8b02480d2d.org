Vasco Croft is the person behind Aphros. As a teen, he dreamed about becoming an astrologist, yet after some consideration, he decided to study architecture. But after discovering Steiner's philosophy, Vasco went to England to study pedagogy and sculpture, where he discovered an interest in woodworking and furniture design. It was enough for a few years until, in his thirties, he met a Buddhist monk. They shared a bottle of wine. For Vasco, it was a meeting with Dionysus himself. This encounter changed his life. As a result, in 2003, he started a wine project in Casal do Paço, a  semi-abandoned property belonging to his family since the 17th century.
