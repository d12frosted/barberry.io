Paolo Vodopivec exclusively focuses on cultivating Carso's native grape variety, Vitovska. Paolo used to experiment with other varieties. Over time, he concluded that Vitovska is the voice of the Carso.

Today, Vodopivec produces up to three distinct bottlings annually. The "Origine" bottling undergoes vinification and ageing solely in large, neutral oak botti. Meanwhile, the classic Vitovska ages for a period ranging from six to twelve months in Georgian qvevri, allowing the skins to impart their character before further maturation in botti. "Solo," considered Vodopivec's Grand Cru, is crafted from their most prized vineyard parcel. It undergoes an entire year of fermentation and ageing in qvevri, culminating in a final passage through the botti for refinement.
