Small German winery from Baden founded in 2006 by two wine college graduates Sven Enderle and Florian Moll. They were fortunate enough to get their hands on some pretty old plots of Pinot Noir sites (planted in 1953). They follow a philosophy of Low Intervention and Sustainable Vineyard Management.

Enderle and Moll are considered to be a cult even by Jancis Robinson. Some consider them the best Pinot Noir producers in Germany. I lack qualification and experience to support this claim, so I am going to challenge it through tasting. So far my experience is mixed and they didn't get more than 15/20. Too natural for me.
