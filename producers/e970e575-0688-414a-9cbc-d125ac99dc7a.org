Valli Unite is a natural wine cooperative. Being created in the 70s, it's, in fact, one of the first in the country (accent on 'natural'). Today they have 30 people on board. It's quite an unorthodox community living and managing this multifunctioning farm of 100 ha, 20 of which are dedicated to vines.
