John Duval is an international winemaking legend and Australian superstar. Before starting a private label, he was a winemaker at Barossa Valley winery Penfolds for 29 years (16 of them, he was a chief). John Duval is responsible for putting together Grange and his signature wine, the RWT.

For the last decade (or even more), Duval travelled around the globe producing high-quality wines in Europe, the North-West of the USA and Chile. But his heart is in the Barossa Valley. Hence his private label was born here in 2003.
