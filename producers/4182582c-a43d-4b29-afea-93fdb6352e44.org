Many Haro bodegas were created by people fleeing from the ravages of phyloxera. Bodegas Bilbaínas is no exception, its origins go back to 1859, when Savignon Frères & Cie set up in Haro. Though the company was created only in 1901. How is it related to Viña Pomal? Well, it is a creation of Don Santiago de Ugarte, co-founder of Bodegas Bilbaínas and the company's first Managing Director. Their first released vintage is 1904.
