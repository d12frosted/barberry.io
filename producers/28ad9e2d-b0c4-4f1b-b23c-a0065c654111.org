Franco Terpin, the fifth of six brothers, hails from a family with a viticultural tradition dating back to the 1970s. It wasn't until the early 1990s that Franco's father took the plunge into winemaking independently, marking a pivotal moment in the family's winemaking journey. This transition sparked a shift towards organic and quality-driven practices, moving away from the market-driven quantity-focused approach.

Based in Valerisce, San Floriano del Collio, Franco Terpin's vineyard spans around 10 hectares on the picturesque slopes of Mount Calvario. Here, they cultivate emblematic local grape varieties like Ribolla Gialla, Pinot Grigio, and Friulano, alongside international varietals such as Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Merlot, and Cabernet Sauvignon. The unique soil, known as "Ponka," is a distinctive feature, characterized by the stratification of marls, sandstones, and clays from the Eocene epoch.
