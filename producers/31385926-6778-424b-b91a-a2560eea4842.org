Casa Coste Piane is located in Valdobbiadene sub-region of Prosecco. And imagine! Loris Follador got this farm with 60+ years old vines and winemaking techniques from his father, who in turn got this all from his father. Loris Follador is a lucky guy with a fortunate legacy. Somehow this family ignored all the 'improvements' from the 60s, so they don't meddle much with vines and wines.
