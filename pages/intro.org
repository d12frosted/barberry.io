Welcome to *Barberry Garden*, a place where we drink wine and talk about wine.

Independent (self-funded) website focused on the wine world. How are wines grown and made? Who is making them? Where and since when? And even how do they taste and why? I am no sommelier and am not affiliated with any wine importer or store. I am just a casual who loves to drink, take notes and tinker with Emacs.

This site is still under development. So most of the planned features are not available yet. Check out the latest [[file:/posts/2022-09-15-site-updates.html][Site Updates]] article to learn about the development process.
