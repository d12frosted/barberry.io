Welcome to *Barberry Garden*, a place where we drink wine and talk about wine.

At the moment this site is under development, so most of the planned features are not available yet, but you already can find some reports - personal and from tasting events.

All content is available either in English or Ukrainian. At this point there are no plans to provide translations.

Join [[https://t.me/barberrygarden][Telegram]] channel to get updates. And also follow me on [[https://www.vivino.com/users/boris.un][Vivino]].
