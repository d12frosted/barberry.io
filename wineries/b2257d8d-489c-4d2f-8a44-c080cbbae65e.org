#+title: Girolamo Russo
#+filetags: :barberry/public:wine:producer:

They say that Girolamo Russo was a pianist in the past. Well, maybe he stopped playing music professionally, but I can say that he started to create music in the form of wine.

Etna, Sicily, around 26 ha of vineyards, half is sold, half is turned into wine. 1 white, 1 ros√© and 4 red wines.
