Easy going, light and well made wine. In the nose it's full of melon, gooseberry, grass and lime. Flavours repeat the same pattern, but flavours of melon are so powerful that it's like drinking non-sweet version of melon. In the taste it's more dull than I remember from previous vintage, though the aftertaste is slightly oily with some wax notes. Good, just not fascinating and simple.
