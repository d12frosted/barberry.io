It has a curious bouquet: black currant, ripe cherry, violets, earth and mushrooms. Despite the pretentious amount of descriptors, it's shy and restrained in the nose. Yet delicate, juicy, round and well-balanced on the palate. Medium body and long aftertaste that beautiful flows from black currant jelly to a chocolate-cherry cake. It's not a lie this time!
