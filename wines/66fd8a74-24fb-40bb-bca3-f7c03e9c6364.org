This Spätburgunder may wear a 3-piece suit, but it doesn't judge me for playing Nintendo Switch (tm?) a whole day with no pants on me. No, it doesn't judge, and instead, it offers a charming and warming bouquet of ripe strawberries, red currant, raw meat, underbrush and clove. It's sophisticated and delicate, yet approachable at the same time. Medium-bodied, balanced and delicious.
