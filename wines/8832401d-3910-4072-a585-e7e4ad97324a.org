A year ago I've tasted Conasbrancas 2019, now it's time for 2018! Highly enjoyable, though IMO this is one of those wines that should be consumed and not aged. Mix of stone fruits with oxidized apple, nettle, butter and oil. Fresh, nice citrus flavours with oily finish.  Overall it's a good field blend with short maceration.
