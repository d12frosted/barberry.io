Tasted blind and didn't guess. Turned out to be gently macerated Malvasia from Lipari (Aeolian Islands)! What a rare and pleasant surprise. Slightly restrained nose with notes of candied stone fruits, mushrooms, earth, and clay. It lacks acidity, but it's still well-balanced. The taste evolution is interesting. At first, it seems to be short, but then the second wave comes with flavours of candied fruits, and then the third wave with a saline finish.
