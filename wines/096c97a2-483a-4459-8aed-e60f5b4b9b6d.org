Restrained and beautiful bouquet of barberry, wild strawberry, cherry confiture, and some gentle whispers of animal touch. Delicious and beautiful wine, juicy and perfectly balanced despite high acidity. Long aftertaste with flavours of strawberry and underbrush hints. Elegant, young and ready to enjoy. Giving it an extra point for elegance and balance with hope that its potential will make it even better with time.
