The first thing I noticed is the label change. It's not critical, but I liked previous one more. Previously it was a baseline Sauvignon Blanc with a label of a good wine, now it's a baseline Sauvignon Blanc with... this label. As you can see, I am talking about label instead of wine itself, so it could be a signal. But in reality, it's totally fine, tropical bomb with matching palate, typical black currant leaves and good acidity. Surprisingly good price.
