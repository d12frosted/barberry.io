Les Arènes is my first Cornas. It has a charming bouquet that evolved over the evening. At first, it was dominated by dark fruits and plum pie. But then it slowly revealed white pepper, raw meat and earthy notes. Not a simple wine, for sure. The combination of freshness, intensity and chewy tannin results in an interesting and elegant experience. Nice.
