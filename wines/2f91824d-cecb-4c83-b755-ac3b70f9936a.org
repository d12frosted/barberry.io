** Producer

Jokingly they say that I am brand ambassador of Vino di Anna. It all boils down to my love for their wines. And how I force people to drink them.

Alright, I didn't expect it to be so damn good. Burst of strawberries and mulberries, violets and underbrush, subtle hints of pickles. Elegant, savoury and tarty. Juicy with very long finish. Definitely my style. Bottle ended too fast :(

I simply love this wine. Dumplings with strawberries, covered with cracklings and cream, mulberries and underbrush, hints of pickles. Elegant, complex with slight funky touch in the taste, long finish and very tasty. I want more.

I have to repeat myself, Don Alfio is very tasty, sophisticated and multilayered wine. Elegant combination of red fruits and underbrush. Hints of red meat and pickles. Tasty, powerful, perfectly balanced. Has potential, which makes me wonder how it will taste in few years. But I doubt that I will get an answer, cause I am going to drink everything now.

The last time I tasted this wine more than a year ago and after reading some tasting notes from other people decided to check it's development. Intense bouquet full of small red fruits, mulberry, underbrush, fresh leather, anise and other spices with pleasant VA touch. On the palate it is still green with powerful and harsh tannin and fruit-forward finish. I want to taste it in 5 years.
