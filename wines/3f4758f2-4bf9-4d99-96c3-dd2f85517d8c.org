4.5 The first magnum in my life. And what a wine! Since 2014 was not simple
year, Stella di Campalto produced only Rosso di Montalcino and the result is
very pleasing. Delicate and sensual. Strawberries mixed with flowers and
mushrooms. Sophisticated nose (I even forgot to make the first sip). Well
balanced and structured, everything in its place. Literally silky. I'd love to
spend my evening with this bottle and a good novel.
