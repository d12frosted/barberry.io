It's a nice and relatively funky Marche Rosso. It offers a beautiful and sweet mix of ripe cherry, liquorice, young leather and VA. Unexpectedly fresh, even elevated, thanks to VA. After a short time, it rounds and becomes complete. Juicy, almost full-bodied with nice tannin, acidity and fruit. It's a good wine to witness the influence of VA. Good value.
