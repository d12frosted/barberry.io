Its dark ruby color offers a new perspective to the senses with a complex aroma of plums and spices. The unique blueberries and chocolate taste attests the oenologist’s craftsmanship in carrying out an exclusive product. Maturation: min. 36 month in French Oak Barrels

Definitely wonderful Merlot from respected winery from the Codru region. It spent 36 months in the french oak barrels. Now at age of 8 years, it become magnificent. Black currant and blueberry jam, raw meat, cacao, prune, vanilla and allspice, toffee, condensed milk. Very well balanced, medium-high tannins and acidity, medium-full body. Very long aftertaste with flavours of blueberry jam and cacao. Something you just drink glass after glass and enjoy life. Now I feel a sudden urge to visit Moldova.

Celebrating Moldova independence day. And that's a bottle for this occasion. Mature bouquet of prune, fig, chocolate, licorice, dried cherry, sweet tobacco, coffee, vanilla and clove. Powerful, kind of new world style, oaky, straightforward and not complex, but tasty mature wine.
