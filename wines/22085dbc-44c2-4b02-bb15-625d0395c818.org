Sophisticated and evolving orange wine. Bursts with papaya and passion fruit yoghurt, canned peach, ice tea with peach, white flowers and amber. Well balanced, pleasant to drink with soft tannins (though long maceration is here), flavourful - canned peach, tea, red ripe apples and VA. Interesting because it has lots of tropical fruits, but it is not vulgar and balances into more sophisticated land. I would love to taste it in few years, but you know... tasty stuff goes quickly.
