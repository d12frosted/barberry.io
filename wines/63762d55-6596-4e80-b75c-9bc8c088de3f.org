A shy kid in the room. Restrained and sophisticated bouquet: cherries, black fruits, chocolate crumbles, spices, earth, and subtle hints of violets. Wait, it's all subtle. It's juicy; it has a medium body, good acidity and tannin. The aftertaste is long but strangely fading (insert some vulgar quotes about autumn). It offers flavours of tea and diluted compote. It reminds me of 3B (sparkling by Filipa Pato) - it also feels empty in the end (please don't sing!). So confused me is sipping this wine and struggling to figure out the answer to the most important question - do I like it? Mostly. But it's overpriced.
