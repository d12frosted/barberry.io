Tasted as part of Classy Bubbles event.

Excellent Sicilian metodo Classico. All the good stuff mixed in one bottle - bubble, complex bouquet and delicious, multilayered palate. Grapefruit, soaked apple, iodine and Jerez. And when you make a sip, it's like letting a sea wave fill and wash your mouth.
