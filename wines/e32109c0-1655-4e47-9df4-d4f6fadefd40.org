** Producer

When Giulio Armani is not busy with [[barberry:/producers/e852c48c-eb2b-48ec-90f2-1ac7f0203073][La Stoppa]], he produces his own wine - Denavolo (macerated for 6 months), Denavolino (similar to Denavolo, but grapes are from lower altitude) and Catavela (macerated from 7 days). His wines are comparable to famous [[barberry:/wines/1f4e920e-bfd4-4624-8445-fa8480962c17][La Stoppa Ageno 2015]].

Some would say that this wine is up to expectations, but considering my experience with previous vintages, I'd say - Dinavolino 2020 is surprisingly pleasant and ready to drink. Typical skin contact wine from a great winemaker. Cider, VA, honey, white flowers, and dried herbs. Fresh, rather light, flavourful, and moderately funky. And most importantly, I want another glass after finishing one. And then one more.
