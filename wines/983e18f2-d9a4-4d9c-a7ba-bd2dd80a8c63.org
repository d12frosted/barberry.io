For the last few days, I consumed too many Pet Nats. Why? I don't know. Do I love them? No. But there are cases where they play well. After a long day under the sun, you drink Loimer Pet Nat like water. Citrus combined with kōcha kinoko, good acidity with lemon flavours. This is the kind of lemonade I agree to drink. If only the price would be adequate...
