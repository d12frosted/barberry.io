When you have little to say about wine, you start sharing information from the label, e.g. grapes, location, etc. But this is completely passable wine, so I will be short: apple, lychee, citrus and lilac flowers. Unfocused, typical.

Tasted on the go, so little time to properly asset it. Completely different from my previous experience. An aromatic tropical shampoo with honey extract and flowers. Flabby and bitter in the finish.
