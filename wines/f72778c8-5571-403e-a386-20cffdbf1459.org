90% Malvasia/10% Ortrugo & Trebbiano Toscano. The varieties are co-planted and
the vines average 30 years of age. The fruit is co-harvested, destemmed and
fermented with native yeasts in tank. Maceration with the skins lasts around 4
months (warmer vintages usually entail a shorter time on the skins and the
cooler ones a longer stretch). Malolactic fermentation normally occurs. In the
spring the wine is racked into botti and aged for at least a year, followed by 2
or more years in bottle before release. There is no sulfur added at any point to
this wine. The vintages are not necessarily released in sequence: for example,
the 2017 has been released (fall 2020) ahead of the 2016. 2017 is also the first
year of a new label design as well as Vino Bianco rather than IGT status. The
name "Ageno" is in homage to the original owner of the estate, Giancarlo Ageno.

4.0 Really happy to taste new release of Ageno. Lots of ripe apricot, even
apricot jam, ripe pear, dill, subtle hints of acetone, spices. In addition to
new label and losing IGT it also got much more residual sugar, this is the first
thing you notice when you taste it. Apricot jam in a liquid state. But then a
powerful wave of rough tannins washes away sweetness, leaving you on a
flavourful dry land. Nice, relatively young, easy to drink.
