90% Malvasia/10% Ortrugo & Trebbiano Toscano. The varieties are co-planted and
the vines average 30 years of age. The fruit is co-harvested, destemmed and
fermented with native yeasts in tank. Maceration with the skins lasts around 4
months (warmer vintages usually entail a shorter time on the skins and the
cooler ones a longer stretch). Malolactic fermentation normally occurs. In the
spring the wine is racked into botti and aged for at least a year, followed by 2
or more years in bottle before release. There is no sulfur added at any point to
this wine. The vintages are not necessarily released in sequence: for example,
the 2017 has been released (fall 2020) ahead of the 2016. 2017 is also the first
year of a new label design as well as Vino Bianco rather than IGT status. The
name "Ageno" is in homage to the original owner of the estate, Giancarlo Ageno.

** Producer

La Stoppa is a legendary historic estate that was founded in 19th century by a lawyer named Giancarlo Ageno. Initially focused on Bordeaux varieties, nowadays its vineyards are occupied by local Barbera, Bonarda and Malvasia. Elena Pantaleoni, current owner of the estate, works closely with famous enologist Giulio Armani (that has his own side project called [[barberry:/producers/53e31c1f-70b3-4504-897d-fe020167f48c][Denavolo]]) to craft wines expressive of place and grape. They are advocates of minimal intervention along with usage of huge Slavonian oak botti and used French barriques. Also they are farming organically since 1990's and in 2008 they even acquired proper certification.

*** 2020-10-12 - â˜† 8.00

4.0 Really happy to taste new release of Ageno. Lots of ripe apricot, even
apricot jam, ripe pear, dill, subtle hints of acetone, spices. In addition to
new label and losing IGT it also got much more residual sugar, this is the first
thing you notice when you taste it. Apricot jam in a liquid state. But then a
powerful wave of rough tannins washes away sweetness, leaving you on a
flavourful dry land. Nice, relatively young, easy to drink.
