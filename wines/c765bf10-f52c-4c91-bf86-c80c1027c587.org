I am like the Listán Blanco. Very resistant.

Yes, Victoria E. Torres Pecis comes from the Canary Islands, specifically from the most north-westerly island - La Palma, La isla bonita as they call it. I know, it's crazy. Western Sahara is on the same latitude! The soils are volcanic and covered with picón, the dark ashy sand. The terrain is rugged. Climatic conditions are extreme. Vineyards are constantly whipped by Atlantic winds. Yet, people grow vines here and even manage to produce wines. There are 18 winemakers on the island, but Victoria Torres Pecis is the only one exported outside Spain.

Victoria Torres Pecis is the sole owner and caretaker of her family's centenarian winery in Fuencaliente. Her father died in 2014. And since then, she has been working alone against the elements and harsh conditions of the island. Victoria learned the winemaking craft by watching her father use an old lagar (dating from 1885) to press grapes and vinify them in chestnut barrels. And not much has changed in the winery over time. It is small, with few stainless steel tanks, old American and French oak, and chestnut barrels. Only native yeasts and no temperature control.

In total, Victoria works on 4.7 hectares: 2 of them are her property, and the rest she rents. She also purchases the grapes from the farmers she works closely with. And all these vineyards are scattered around the island - from the southern tip to the west side of Roque de Los Muchachos. That also means that the altitude varies - some are at 1500 m above sea level. All vines are ungrafted (as mentioned on the labels) because phylloxera never reached The Canaries. And she works with quite old vines - some are older than 130 years!

Oh my, I tasted it blind and had no specific ideas. There was a hint that it was white without any skin contact. Why no ideas? It has Madeira-like colour. It smells like ice Lipton tea with peach. In addition, there are dried fruits, nuts, spices, fermented fish, and soy sauce. And to confuse me even more, it has a well-integrated tannin. Mind-blowing! Turned out to be 2013/2017 Solera Listán Blanco from the Canary Islands. On the back label, it says that 800 bottles were produced, but on the front label, there is a handwritten text - 449/660. In any case, small production. Unique and complex wine.
