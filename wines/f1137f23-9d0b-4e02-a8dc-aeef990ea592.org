Tasted blind. My guesses were around [[barberry:/producers/0608acc9-e36c-4cff-970e-0f2489d3011a][Fedellos do Couto]] and  [[barberry:/producers/cdc80e0e-1163-4b33-916d-e6806e5073e3][Matassa]], but with influence from Sextant. Entry-level funky-style wine. Slightly restrained and simple in the nose with notes of sweet cherry, cranberry and spoiled jam. But it pays well in the taste. Fizzy at the beginning, salty with flavours of spoiled strawberry-cranberry jam but with the right volume and evolution based on jamminess. I would take it on a picnic, chill a little bit, and then chill together with a bottle or two of this wine.

Wine #4 on [[barberry:/posts/2022-06-07-blind-tasting][a blind tasting event]] by Vasyl Kalinichenko in 101 Bar.
