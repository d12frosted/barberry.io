I feared that this will be devastating, brutal experience. Not sure if I just
became more tolerant, or it's just a mismatch of wine with its name, but I
enjoyed the bottle. Lots of red fruits, sour beer and Raclette. A little bit
funky, but tasty.

Tasting again in almost 5 months, and now I like it a little bit more
as it become deeper and less nervous. Reductive sour notes and burst
of red fruits. Not simple. Fresh, flavours of black fruits, well
integrated reductive character.
