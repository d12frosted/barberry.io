Well made orange wine from famous La Stoppa. Apricot jam, soaked apples, wild flowers, honey, orange peel, walnuts. Full bodied, well balanced, great structure. Apple juice acidity and tannins. Long finish. Sophisticated and very tasty.

Beautiful, tasty, complex and sophisticated as always. As someone said, it is always a pleasure to drink this wine. Apricot jam, dried flowers, honey, pickles, orange peel and walnuts. Apples juice flavours, long finish... yummy!

It's interesting to taste this wine again after such a long pause. Well, that's because 2015 is a rare vintage nowadays. Apricot jam, honey, wild dried flowers, baked apples. Acetone hints present at the beginning fade away with time. Powerful and opulent wine.

Legendary wine :) Deep copper colour. Soaked watermelon, wet wood, pickled tomato, white plum, buckwheat honey and sauerkraut. Flavours of sauerkraut and baked apples with honey and cinnamon. Complex, powerful, balanced and multi-layered wine that evolves over the evening, a great companion to have a conversation with! Happy me!

Unfortunately, this is my last bottle of Ageno 2015. Since my last tasting almost a year ago, it developed even further into beautiful stage. Deep hazy amber colour. Beautiful, pronounced and complex bouquet full of apricot jam, buckwheat honey, baked apples, acetone, medicinal herbs and amber. Full-bodied and still crisp with medium-high round tannin, great balance and powerful flavours matching the nose. Very long and evolving aftertaste. Masterpiece.
