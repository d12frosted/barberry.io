La Stoppa is a legendary historic estate that was founded in 19th century by a lawyer named Giancarlo Ageno. Initially focused on Bordeaux varieties, nowadays its vineyards are occupied by local Barbera, Bonarda and Malvasia. Elena Pantaleoni, current owner of the estate, works closely with famous enologist Giulio Armani (that has his own side project called Denavolo) to craft wines expressive of place and grape. They are advocates of minimal intervention along with usage of huge Slavonian oak botti and used French barriques. Also they are farming organically since 1990's and in 2008 they even acquired proper certification.

Well made orange wine from famous La Stoppa. Apricot jam, soaked apples, wild flowers, honey, orange peel, walnuts. Full bodied, well balanced, great structure. Apple juice acidity and tannins. Long finish. Sophisticated and very tasty.

Beautiful, tasty, complex and sophisticated as always. As someone said, it is always a pleasure to drink this wine. Apricot jam, dried flowers, honey, pickles, orange peel and walnuts. Apples juice flavours, long finish... yummy!

It's interesting to taste this wine again after such a long pause. Well, that's because 2015 is a rare vintage nowadays. Apricot jam, honey, wild dried flowers, baked apples. Acetone hints present at the beginning fade away with time. Powerful and opulent wine.

Legendary wine :) Deep copper colour. Soaked watermelon, wet wood, pickled tomato, white plum, buckwheat honey and sauerkraut. Flavours of sauerkraut and baked apples with honey and cinnamon. Complex, powerful, balanced and multi-layered wine that evolves over the evening, a great companion to have a conversation with! Happy me!

Unfortunately, this is my last bottle of Ageno 2015. Since my last tasting almost a year ago, it developed even further into beautiful stage. Deep hazy amber colour. Beautiful, pronounced and complex bouquet full of apricot jam, buckwheat honey, baked apples, acetone, medicinal herbs and amber. Full-bodied and still crisp with medium-high round tannin, great balance and powerful flavours matching the nose. Very long and evolving aftertaste. Masterpiece.
