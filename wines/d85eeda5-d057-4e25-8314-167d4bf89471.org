** Producer

Elisabetta Foradori bears a reputation as a very nice and elegant person who mixes seriousness with cheerfulness. Every person I know who met her comes back in awe.

As a winemaker, her career started not by her own will but from unexpected circumstances. Her father's early death hurled her life into family estate management. Initially, out of a sense of duty and then from newly born passion, she became a rising star.

Though the 90s, Elisabetta Foradori was known as "the queen of Teroldego". Yet, by 2000 she lost all personal connection to her work and started to question everything, to experiment. That's how she came to biodynamics, amphoras, the decision to replant the majority of the land from pergola to guyot, and radical changes in vinification.

Today her children help with the winery. Emilio, the eldest, is responsible for viticulture and winemaking since 2013. Theo travels to represent the winery and to communicate with importers and distributors. And Myrtha transforms the winery into a full-blown polycultural farm. They even produce cheese these days!

Sweet red fruits, acid sweets, touch of dried meat, hint of funky notes, brown ale. High acidity, medium tannins. Not balanced (acidity and ethanol), too young, bad QPR. Nevertheless, brown ale is an interesting experience.

Gave it a second chance, this time I let it to decant for more than 90 minutes. And result is pleasing. Easy to enjoy
wine, well balanced, kind of direct. Lots of yeast, brown ale and black fruits. Long coffee beans aftertaste. Not wow,
but something I would happy to drink over a good conversation. Just need to give it more time to breath.
