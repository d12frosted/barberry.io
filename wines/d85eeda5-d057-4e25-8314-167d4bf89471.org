Sweet red fruits, acid sweets, touch of dried meat, hint of funky notes, brown ale. High acidity, medium tannins. Not balanced (acidity and ethanol), too young, bad QPR. Nevertheless, brown ale is an interesting experience.

Gave it a second chance, this time I let it to decant for more than 90 minutes. And result is pleasing. Easy to enjoy
wine, well balanced, kind of direct. Lots of yeast, brown ale and black fruits. Long coffee beans aftertaste. Not wow,
but something I would happy to drink over a good conversation. Just need to give it more time to breath.
