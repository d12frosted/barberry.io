More than a year ago on a blind tasting party I've tried Chablis by Raoul Clerget. And based on impression from Raoul Clerget Chablis 2018, my expectation were not big. Crowd-pleasing Crémant, easy going and tasty. It's full of dark bread croutons, cream and stone fruits. Well balanced, though sweetness is too high for me. On the other hand, I like croutons made of dark bread.
