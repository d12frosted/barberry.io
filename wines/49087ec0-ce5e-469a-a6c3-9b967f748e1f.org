More than a year ago on a blind tasting party I've tried Chablis by [[barberry:/producers/4654ba3e-7c28-40fe-80b4-6639e8ff26e4][Raoul Clerget]]. And based on impression from [[barberry:/wines/8ca732d2-d35b-4b9a-9b01-e68fc2ebe3d4][Raoul Clerget Chablis 2018]], my expectation were not big. Crowd-pleasing Crémant, easy going and tasty. It's full of dark bread croutons, cream and stone fruits. Well balanced, though sweetness is too high for me. On the other hand, I like croutons made of dark bread.
