In 1347 Queen Joanna of Naples was exiled to Avignon. Caught in the mistral, she sought refuge in the small castle of a gentleman glazier. When she was shown into his atelier the next day, she startled the artisan at his work. The result was a bulbous vessel that could hold ten liters. Instead of calling the broad-shaped bottle Jeanne-Reine, the modest queen suggested he call it Lady Jane, or Dame-Jeanne. Our Damejeanne is a red cuvée of grapes made from two vineyards in the hills and valleys of Vermont. Both were fermented on their skins with native yeasts and blended after a year of élevage in glass demijohns. This alpine wine is unfiltered and unfined. From our cantina to your table.

Damejeanne, made from Marquette in the Vergennes vineyard, fruity, bright, and lively for now, but also good for putting away.

Champlain Valley ~ Les Carouges, Vergennes vineyard
