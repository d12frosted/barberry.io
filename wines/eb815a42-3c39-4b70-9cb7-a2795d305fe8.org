Marquette is an inter-species hybrid red wine grape variety. Like most other hybrids used in Vermont, it was developed at the University of Minnesota as part of its grape breeding program[fn:1]. Its goal is to develop high-quality, cold-hardy, and disease-resistant wine cultivars. Marquette is a cross between the other two hybrids - MN 1094[fn:2] (aka Minnesota 1094) and Ravat 262[fn:3] (aka Ravat Noir). Marquette was introduced in 2006 and has good resistance to downy mildew, powdery mildew, and black rot, as well as being cold hardy (survives -37°C when fully dormant).

In 1347 Queen Joanna of Naples was exiled to Avignon. Caught in the mistral, she sought refuge in the small castle of a gentleman glazier. When she was shown into his atelier the next day, she startled the artisan at his work. The result was a bulbous vessel that could hold ten liters. Instead of calling the broad-shaped bottle Jeanne-Reine, the modest queen suggested he call it Lady Jane, or Dame-Jeanne.

Marquette grapes are sourced from Vergennes vineyard located on the hills and valleys of Vermont. Grapes are fermented on their skins with native yeasts and blended after a year of élevage in glass demijohns.

Wine #5 on [[barberry:/posts/2023-05-26-mixed-bag][Mixed Bag Vol. 7]].

100% Marquette, a hybrid cold-hardy variety. Every bottle from this winery is something unique (no quality connotations, just fact). Earthy-driven bouquet with notes of isabella grape, violets, dogwood, horse and a pile of wet autumn leaves. Mineral, not simple and demanding. Interesting to taste, but not for everyone.
