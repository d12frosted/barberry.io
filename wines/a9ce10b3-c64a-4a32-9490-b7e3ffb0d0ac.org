Always stylish and unique. Sophisticated bouquet full of nuts, honey,
peach and other yellow fruits, plus aloe vera. Slightly mineral
profile, pleasant salinity on the palate. Great structure and volume,
well balanced, fresh, 14abv is something you don't notice right away.
Great value. Goes wonderful solo, with grilled white fish - it's
perfect.
