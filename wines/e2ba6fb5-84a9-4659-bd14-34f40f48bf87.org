This is a teenager Cortese that decided to become a punk. But its parents accept the whims of the youth. So the rebelling spirit stays tamed. The bouquet is full of spoiled white plums, soaked white flowers, raw dough, kōcha kinoko, smoke, and pickles. To my taste, it lacks acidity (so not sure what destiny awaits this little rebel). Overall it is complex, multilayerd, and even has some delicacy. And all these umami flavours (hello, mr Shiitake)! And the aftertaste of ripe, even baked fruits and pickles. A good find, for sure.
