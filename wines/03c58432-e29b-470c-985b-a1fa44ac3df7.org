*** 2020-12-31 - ☆ 8.20

Friendly and non overwhelming. Bruised apples, lemon and chalk. Not simple, refreshing, mineral and delicious Champagne with long aftertaste.

*** 2021-12-21 - ☆ 8.25

Tasted as part of [[barberry:/posts/2021-12-21-classy-bubbles][Classy Bubbles]] event.

Basic Champagne by Bérêche, 24 months on lees, degorgee on 06/2021. Great and complex bouquet - red apple baked with honey, flowers, lemon, Jerez and chalk. Great structure and balance. Mineral touch makes it more interesting. Sweeter side makes it more friendly. Nice.
