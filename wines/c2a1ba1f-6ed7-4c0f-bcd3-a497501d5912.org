Love at the first sniff. Clean style and sophisticated Zibibbo from Marco De Bartoli. It is fruity, but now overwhelming, salty as pebbles on the sea shore, and cheesy (in a very good way). Perfectly balanced, elegant with long finish and flavours of salt and white fruits. You just take a bottle and can't stop enjoying it until it's over.

This wine impressed me when I tasted it for the first time a year ago. So I was afraid to taste it again, because I wanted it to always stay magnificent in my memory. But... here I am with a glass of Pietra Nera. Pickles, apples and sea breeze - this is how it starts. Then it opens up more, revealing ginger, white plum and rose petals. Light, well balanced with long and evolving and flavourful finish - citrus, green apple with saline notes. Was not disappointed.
