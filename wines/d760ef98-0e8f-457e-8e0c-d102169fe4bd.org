La Stoppa is a legendary historic estate that was founded in 19th century by a lawyer named Giancarlo Ageno. Initially focused on Bordeaux varieties, nowadays its vineyards are occupied by local Barbera, Bonarda and Malvasia. Elena Pantaleoni, current owner of the estate, works closely with famous enologist Giulio Armani (that has his own side project called Denavolo) to craft wines expressive of place and grape. They are advocates of minimal intervention along with usage of huge Slavonian oak botti and used French barriques. Also they are farming organically since 1990's and in 2008 they even acquired proper certification.

Skip Party #7. New release of this legendary wine. It is still very
young and maybe even stressed a little. I am obliged to give it
another try in few weeks at least. Sulfur dioxide requires some time
of aeration, burnt oak, and then lots of flowers, orange peel, spices
and acacia honey. Fresh, crispy and delicious. Much lighter than 2015,
but at least not a syrup, unlike 2017.

Tasting again in 3 months to check its development. It's less stressed
now, and it become more open. Soaked apples, tilia honey, medicinal
herbs, apricot jam, bergamot and orange peel. Sophisticated, powerful
and delicious wine. It still has potential to become more deep and
interesting, so going to taste it again in the future.
