Tasted as part of Classy Bubbles event.

Seriously, I did my best to enjoy this wine. And on the nose it's good, simple and fruit-forward but good. Apples, oak touch, candied pear. No signs of stated 36 months on lees, but ok. The real problem is the taste - apple seeds and nothing more. To the point that there is no pleasure in drinking it, so I could not finish even 5cl. So the score is mostly for nose.
