It was a pure joy and a surprise to find Cuvee 742 as I already gave up few months ago. Definitely a milestone for me. Cuvee 742 is complex multilayered wine. Baked apple, sunflower oil, pumpkin seeds, yeast, raw dough, butter, creme brulee and notes of plastic. Perfectly balanced, structured, evolving with very long finish with flavours of cider, burnt plastic and candy.
