Tasted blind. My guesses were around some autochthonous grapes from Italy, most likely Umbria. But only to think that it's Baga! Just few days ago I told that I haven't tasted Baga for a while and would love to repeat. In addition, I always wanted to taste this particular wine. Shame that I didn't enjoy it. Considering it's age, it's unlikely that it will become better. Straight-forward and simple wine focused around sour cherry both in the nose, flavours, acidity and tannin. It's OK with food, but otherwise harsh.
