Sálvora is the Grand Cru of [[barberry:/producers/2d248b79-e202-497b-9cff-b59fb04c5ffc][Rodrigo Méndez]]. Made from the 115 years old pre-phylloxera vines grown in the village of Meaño, in Val do Salnés (credited as the birthplace of Albariño). The region skirts the coast and produces wines with intense minerality and salinity. Fermented in foudres and aged in used oak barrels for 12 months.
