Le Clos de Mosny is a single-vineyard cuvée of 12.5 hectares, reduced to old vines of Chenin Blanc from the best geological zone (about 8 hectares). The vineyard is fully owned by Domaine de La Taille Aux Loups, hence the 'monopole' designation. The vines are 40-50 years old. They grow on sand clay soil with lots of silexes on pure limestone (2-3 meters before hitting the limestone). The ageing lasts 1 year on fine lees in barrels (20% new, 80% 1-4-year-old barrels).

** Producer

Domaine de La Taille Aux Loups has an interesting history. Although it's now associated with esteemed winemaker Jacky Blot, he wasn't the one who established the domaine. The viticultural maverick who brought La Taille aux Loups into being was Christian Prudhomme, a man from Bordeaux.

Prudhomme wanted to shake things up in Montlouis-sur-Loire. With experience working in the vineyards and cellars of Château Mouton-Rothschild, as well as at Opus One in California, he acquired 7 hectares of old vines in 1988 and set about making wine his way. This included reducing yields by thinning crops, harvesting into small crates to protect the fruit, and fermenting with indigenous yeasts in barrels purchased from Château d'Yquem. The resulting wines were reportedly a testament to his wild dedication.
However, the business collapsed within a year of starting up, for reasons that remain unclear. This was where Jacky Blot entered the story, marking the start of Montlouis' dynamic development, thanks in no small part to his ambitious and active efforts (alongside François Chidaine, another esteemed winemaker from Montlouis).

After working as a courtier for some time, Jacky Blot decided to look for vineyards of his own. The small domaine that Prudhomme had gathered together was available, and Jacky took up where his predecessor had left off, with just those 7 hectares of vines. It was around this time that he met Christophe Mesliand, the son of a viticultural family from Amboise. Jacky hired Christophe as his chef de culture, and the two have worked together at La Taille aux Loups ever since.

Domaine de La Taille Aux Loups is located just 11km from Vouvray, so the house's speciality is Chenin Blanc. However, Blot drew great inspiration from Burgundy, and many of the wines follow a single-vineyard, terroir-driven approach, with a focus on organic viticulture. These whites are known for their precision, length, complexity, and age-ability.

Sadly, Jacky Blot passed away on May 15, 2023. His legacy will live on through the wines produced by his son Jean-Philippe and the teams at Domaine de la Taille aux Loups and Domaine de la Butte (another winery he owned).

Expressive and sophisticated bouquet with benzene notes, Jerez, nuts, tilia honey, slightly rotten mandarins. With time the nose evolves, calms down and you get green tea with jasmine as a bonus. Multilayered wine, with long jerez-like evolving taste, flavours of green almond and yellow fruits with benzene. Great wine, wonderful QPR, shame it's not available anymore.
