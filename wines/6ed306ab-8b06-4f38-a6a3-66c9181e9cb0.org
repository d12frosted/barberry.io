Expressive and sophisticated bouquet with benzene notes, Jerez, nuts,
tilia honey, slightly rotten mandarins. With time the nose evolves,
calms down and you get green tea with jasmine as a bonus. Multilayered
wine, with long jerez-like evolving taste, flavours of green almond
and yellow fruits with benzene. Great wine, wonderful QPR, shame it's
not available anymore.
