The 2020 season was the first of three very wet winters, which were followed by wet springs and, at this time, two mild summers. Though yields have been low, they've delivered some very detailed, precise and complex wines, which is no small achievement. There's no doubt that these wines are the product of the extraordinarily long ripening periods we've experienced in recent times and though the 2020 harvest was extremely small – with tiny quantities of wine being made – both Megan and I are very proud of this release and know that you'll find plenty to love too.

A 100% Chardonnay from 40 years old vines of Bull Swamp vineyard on volcanic soils. The hand-harvested grapes are gently pressed by a pneumatic press. Juice is left to settle, then racked off its lees into barrels to ferment. Alcoholic fermentation takes two weeks, followed by malolactic fermentation in barrels. The wine spends 12 months in French oak barrels, 30% of which is new oak.

** Producer

Patrick Sullivan works with his wife Megan in Yarra Valley to produce authentic wines on their farm in the Strezleki ranges, Baw Baw Shire, Gippsland, Australia. Patrick portrays himself as a farmer and not a winemaker. His vines are pure, intriguing and honest. His labels are catchy. Don't believe me? Just take a closer look!

I do not put myself in the category of Natural Wines. I only make wine. Natural Wine is a constructed term that I do not like very much. I make wine in the way I like it and in the style that I like to drink and I do not feel better than someone who acidifies or uses selected yeasts. I do not do it because I do not like it. I do it differently.

Patrick's path to winemaking began at a young age. Some say that at age of 12, he spent time planting vines during the school break. His personal site says that his first vinous "whiff" came whilst climbing the hills on a farm his family once owned. In any case, this initial spark developed into fascination and determination. So after finishing high school, Patrick spent two years travelling in Europe to learn winemaking techniques. His love for the craft only grew, so once he returned to his homeland, he studied botany and actuarial science. After post-graduate, Patrick wanted to learn from somebody. And so he went on to gain invaluable experience by working alongside respected winemakers (such as Stuart Proud, William Downie, Anna Martens and Eric Narioo) in various organically and biodynamically managed vineyards in Victoria.

After some time, he gained enough experience, knowledge and confidence to start own projects.

Wine #1 on [[barberry:/posts/2023-03-28-oceania-of-time][Oceania of Time]].

Pretty much every bottle of Patric Sullivan wine is a feast. A beautiful bouquet of buttered croissants, lime, green apple, melon, and apple seeds. It is fresh, mineral and round. Almost perfectly balanced. Still young. Enjoyful today, but should be even more gorgeous in the coming years.
