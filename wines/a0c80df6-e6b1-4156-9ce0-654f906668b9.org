A blend of Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc and Pinot Grigio from 60-year-old vineyards of 10 hectares on marl and sandstone. Hand harvested grapes are fermented spontaneously for 22 days in open chestnut vats on skins. Aged in wood for 24 months.

** Producer

Dario Prinčič formed the winery in 1993. Before that, the family was selling grapes to other wineries in the region. In six years, Dario started to experiment with maceration for white wines. This gave wines such complexity and texture, which Dario loved so much that he decided to macerate the whole production the following year.

Today, the family owns 10 hectares of densely planted vines on the soil composed of clay and sandstone.

Honestly, this blend didn't really deliver. It was complex in a negative way. Maybe we should've decanted it, whatever. Not that typical bomb in the glass, it has a nice and well-weaved VA into a bouquet of stone fruits, apricot, medicinal herbs, orange peel, nuts and pencil husks. A bit diluted, closed and not friendly.
