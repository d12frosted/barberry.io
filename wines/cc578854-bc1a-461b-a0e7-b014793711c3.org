Tasted blind and guessed producer. Since it is my first time tasting this particular wine, I didn't guess the name (at least guessed that it's not Liaison). Aromatic bouquet with typical low intervention style notes. Acetone, red flowers, salami and truffles. While it has beautiful and complex bouquet, it doesn't deliver in the taste. Lacks balance, finish is too bitter, tannin is too powerful, aftertaste is too short. Could be better with time though.
