Had to hunt a little bit for this bottle and honestly (despite my efforts) I didn't expect it to be that good. Beautiful bouquet of sour cherry, spices, red flowers and mushrooms. Well balanced, fresh, elegant and easy going. Now my only desire is to taste the same bottle in few years, seems like it has a good potential. Wonderful QPR.
