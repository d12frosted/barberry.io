Up to expectations. Simple yet pleasant Crémant from Loire. Notes of crème brûlée, apple, soaked apple, quince and... I think that's it. Matching flavours, good volume, but weak bubbles. It also lacks in acidity for my taste, so I'd call it liquid ice cream with bubbles. Good entry level into Brut territory.
