Up to expectations. Simple yet pleasant Crémant from Loire with interesting choice of grapes: Chenin Blanc, Cabernet Franc and Chardonnay. Notes of crème brûlée, apple, soaked apple, quince and... I think that's it. Matching flavours, good volume, but weak bubbles. It also lacks in acidity for my taste, so I'd call it liquid ice cream with bubbles. Good entry level into Brut territory.
