Fruit-forward Xinomavro from Naoussa. Red berries, leather and subtle raw meat hints. Medium-light, good tannins. Simple, but easy going, which is nice.

It became so much better in one year. Pale ruby colour. Aromatic bouquet full of plum, cherry, fallen leaves and red berries compote. Juicy and delicious, fresh with medium body, round medium tannin and good balance. Easy going Xinomavro by wonderful winery.
