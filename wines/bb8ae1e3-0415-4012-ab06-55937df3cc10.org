Stanko Radikon is a legendary farmer and winemaker from a legendary region. He and his friends ([[barberry:/producers/bd1ae49f-3ec6-4701-b633-832d29f929f8][Gravner]]) started period of renaissance for amber wines - white wines with extended skin maceration. But of course, in town of Oslavia it was called "Slovenian" or "Friuli" style - hand-harvesting, skin contact, large and older barrel fermentation without any temperature control, no added yeasts or enzymes, and little to no use of sulfur.

The vineyards were originally planted in the beginning of XX century by Stanko’s grandfather Franz Mikulus with the local favorite, the Ribolla Gialla grape. And basically, Stanko went back to the ways his grandfather was producing wines back in 30s.

After Stanko passing away in 2016, his son Saša took the winery in his hands. Though people say that nothing has really changed in the philosophy of Radikon winery as Saša has been helping out since he was a kid and a partner since 2006.

Every bottle of Radikon is a celebration, but Jakot 2013 is even more. Amazing orange wine. Maybe a little bit too pompous, but unforgettable experience. Buckwheat honey, apricot jam, persimmon, orange zest, dried herbs, nuts. Complex structure, balanced and delicious. Food-friendly and performs well solo. 100% Tocai Friulano, 50cl.
