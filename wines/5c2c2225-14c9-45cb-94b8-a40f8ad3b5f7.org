Interesting winery from Argentina, unique for its late releases and good price. Complex, intense and
deep result, that can be enjoyed solo or (oh boy) with grilled red meat. Pronounced bouquet of black
currant, jam, vanilla, chocolate. Not simple, juicy and delicious. Wonderful value.

One of the best QPR when it comes to aged bottles. Deep garnet colour, powerful and mature bouquet showing its age: jam, sweet tobacco and berries. Full-bodied with almost soft tannin, fresh and well balanced. Complex and delicious wine.
