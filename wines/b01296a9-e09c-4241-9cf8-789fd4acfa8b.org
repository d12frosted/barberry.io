Skin Party #3. Interesting orange wine. Good example of rustic,
gastronomic palate with gorgeous (a little bit volatile) bouquet of
apricot jam, pine cones jam, handful of spices, nuts, dried flowers,
and pickled tomato. It's thick, tannic and full-bodied. Rating is
mostly because of the aroma, because the palate is one-dimensional and
14.5 abv are not well balanced here. Still, wonderful wine!
