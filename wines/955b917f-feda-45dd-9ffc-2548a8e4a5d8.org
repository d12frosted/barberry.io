Tasted blind and thought that it's a new world Chardonnay. Quite a mistake haha. Closed nose. Yellow stone fruits, flowers, cream, hints of soaked apples and roasted nuts. Creamy palate, nice acidity. Unfocused. With time it becomes more boring, almost all aroma is gone - only sauerkraut hints with fruit stone.
