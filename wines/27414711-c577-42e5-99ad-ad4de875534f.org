The star of demanding evening proved the title. Despite young age, it
shows complexity and elegance. Restrained bouquet of violets, red
flowers, mulberry, dried cherries, chocolate powder with touch of
funny cranberry. Wonderful palate, perfectly balanced and deep with
very long aftertaste. I love its raw but noble energy of youth.
Already delicious and mind blowing, and I wonder what will come with
time. World of wine is wonderful.
