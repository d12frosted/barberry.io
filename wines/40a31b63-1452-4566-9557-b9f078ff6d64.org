One of my favourite producers from Champagne. Entre Ciel & Terre is more delicate than, say, Origenelle, showing less oxidation. And 2014-based Entre Ciel is also more delicate than 2013-based. Pale yellow colour. Powerful bouquet showing age (hey 48 sur lies): baked apple, toast, oil, lemon tart, Jerez, brioche, field flowers. Medium-full bodied, intense, complex and delicious.
