After long day of bar crawling I craved for an oaked Chardonnay with MLF. Unfortunately, this is the only bottle they could offer for my description. Elusive aroma of peach, apple seeds, butter, melon and clove. Round and smooth taste matching fruity aroma, but more pleasant. Overall, good and simple oaked Chardonnay with questionable QPR.
