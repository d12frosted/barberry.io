Annexus Grenache is made from grapes sourced from 150+ years old low-yielding vines from Northern Barossa and Eden Valley. The wine is aged for a year in older hogsheads, so the oak impact is minimal. Only 250 cases produced.

** Producer

John Duval is an international winemaking legend and Australian superstar. Before starting a private label, he was a winemaker at Barossa Valley winery Penfolds for 29 years (16 of them, he was a chief). John Duval is responsible for putting together Grange and his signature wine, the RWT.

For the last decade (or even more), Duval travelled around the globe producing high-quality wines in Europe, the North-West of the USA and Chile. But his heart is in the Barossa Valley. Hence his private label was born here in 2003.

I love those situations when you taste a wine with little knowledge about itself and its producer, so you have less expectations. Typical, but very well made Grenache from Barossa Valley. Fruit-forward, with lots of leather and licorice hints. Not overly complicated, but not vulgar.
