4.0 La Bandita is Nadia Verrua, padronina of Cascina Tavijn, small property (7
hectares) that abandoned DOC/DOCG classification to make wine as they see fit.
Average vine age for Barbera is around 40 years. Long maceration, around a year
in concrete vat. Result? Great Barbera! Black berries, tobacco, bloody something
meaty. Gosh, I tasted a glass and took a bottle. Why? Because I felt a little
bit Bandita!

4.0 Consistently good natural Barbera. I think I can drink it every day. Stewed red fruits, bread
notes, humidor. It has small reductive hint, but it does not ruin experience. Good balance, jammy,
you can almost chew it. It's really tasty.
