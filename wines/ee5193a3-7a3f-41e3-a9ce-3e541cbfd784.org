A wine that I got by accident (thank you, Anna) and enjoyed till the very last drop. A lovely combination of a maturing bouquet with a juicy and developed palate. Tobacco, old leather, cherry confiture and cinnamon. Good balance, even despite the declining acidity. Tannin is well-integrated and mature. The fruit is of good quality. It's just a pleasure to drink with its velvety texture and slightly sweet aftertaste (like a cherry confiture combined with a good cigar) that quickly evolves into cinnamon and menthol. It seems to be at its peak, so better to drink now.
