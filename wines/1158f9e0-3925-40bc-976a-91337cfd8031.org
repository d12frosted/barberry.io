My expectations where low and luckily I was not disappointed. Mediocre fruity Chardonnay that tries to stay in a 'healthy' dry zone while satisfying off-dry lovers. Stone fruits, peach and subtle hints of butter. Restrained nose. Viscose, off-dry palate with powerful finish of crushed apple seeds. Not bad, not good, just something to consume and forget about. IMO, the price tag must be cut in half, $15 is a rip off for this.
