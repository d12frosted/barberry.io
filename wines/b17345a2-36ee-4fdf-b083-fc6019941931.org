Textbook Sauvignon Blanc from New Zealand, so IMO everyone needs to taste it time to time as it's a classic and bright example of this specific style. And here I am, doing my part for the first time in 2 years. Tropical notes of passion fruit, gooseberry and apples (yeah, known tropical fruit). But what I like the most about this wine is acidity, making it fresh and amazing choice for hot summer days. So overall it's simple yet good.
