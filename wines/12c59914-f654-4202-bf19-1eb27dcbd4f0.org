Tasted as part of [[barberry:/posts/2021-12-21-classy-bubbles][Classy Bubbles]] event.

Loud name. And I tasted it at last. Magnum bottle. Friendly and highly
approachable. Toast, baked red apple, citrus, cream and nuts. Good
mousse, good volume, fresh and well balanced. Tasty, not complex and
kind of overpriced.
