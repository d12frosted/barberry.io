The grapes are sourced from the high altitude (600m). The second fermentation occurs in tanks and then the wine spends 5 months on lees. After bottling, it is aged for additional 5 months before release.

I was sceptical about this wine. But it turned out to be 'an everyday luxury' sparkling. Friendly thanks to the straightforward bouquet and creamy palate. Apparently, ageing on lees creates wonders even with the tank method. Buttered croissants, cream soda and baked pears. Round, playful, and flavourful. For my taste, it's too sweet, but stingy acidity balances it out.
