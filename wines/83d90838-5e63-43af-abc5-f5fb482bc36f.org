Amazing Chenin Blanc by the maestro. Subtle aromas of quince, gun powder, iodine, acacia blossoms, and wet stones. Good acidity, precise and mineral palate. It's a delicate and complex wine with breathtaking evolution of taste. The finish is delicious and almost eternal. Oh boy, and that astringent feeling of eating a quince... Happy to taste it in a good shape. Still has potential.
