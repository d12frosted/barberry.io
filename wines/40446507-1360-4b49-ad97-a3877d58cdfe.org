I definitely enjoy amount and quality of technical information on the official site. Wish I could say the same about the wine itself though. Nose of medium intensity, featuring fresh leather, musk and blackberry. On the palate it's unfocused, diluted with short and spicy finish. Not my cup of... wine.
