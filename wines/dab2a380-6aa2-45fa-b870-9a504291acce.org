Ruby with bronze hues, a colour typical for the Xinomavro sourced from Amyndeon.
Intense aromas of wild strawberry and cherry entwine with fine herbal hints,
while on the palate the pronounced freshness balanced with the ample body,
offering a wine with great elegance.

The base wine stays on its lees and is frequently stirred for 14 months in 2 and
3-year-old French oak barrels. The wine ages for 1 more year in the bottle.

Kali Riza is produced from 100% Xinomavro grapes grown in the area of Amyndeon,
in Northwestern Greece. The grapes are carefully selected on harvest depending
on their age and content in sugars, phenols and acids. Upon delivery at the
winery, they are chilled at a temperature of 8-10 οC. After destemming, the
grapes are crushed and left to cold soak for 6 days at 10 οC, a process aiming
at the extraction of more color and aromas. The alcoholic fermentation lasts 2
weeks and is followed by 1 week of post-fermentation maceration. After this
period, the wine is transferred to the barrels, were it is left to mature for 14
months. During this time, the wine undergoes malolactic fermentation while it is
gently stirred on its lees. Finally, the wine is bottled and left to mature for
1 additional year

Ripe and profound. Black fruits, raw meat and herbal notes. Refreshing, with good acidity. But it is not as balanced as I would love it to be. Not sure if unlucky bottle. Ethanolic. Expected more.
