A young family-owned winery from Ștefan Vodă, Moldova. Alexandru Luchianov purchased the land in 2002 and started to grow vines in 2003. The first harvest and bottling were rewarded in a local competition in 2005. In 2006 his brother Igor joined this project.

On 24.2 ha, they cultivate Merlot, Cabernet Franc, Fetească Neagră, Saperavi, Carmenere, Cabernet Sauvignon, Pinot Noir, Marselan, Albarosa, Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc and Viognier.

My favourite winery from Ștefan Vodă. Beautiful nose full of strawberry stew, forest floor, herbs, mushrooms and bloody meat. Juicy, more ripe than I would like it to be, but elegant and well-balanced with medium body. Neat.

Tasted again in a more appropriate environment - chilled and served in big Zalto glasses. Pale garnet colour. Warm and oldish bouquet: rich strawberry compote, bitter herbs, dill, wet forest floor, raw meat, mushrooms and hints of rabbit fur. Medium body, juicy, elegant and stylish. It would be nice to have higher acidity. It's getting close to its peak, so don't hide too far away. Better drink within a year or two.
