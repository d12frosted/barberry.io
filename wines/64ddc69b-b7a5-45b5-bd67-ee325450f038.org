Beautiful and rich Madeira. Perfectly balanced.

Wonderful Madeira that easily makes you fall in love with this style. Deep dark amber colour. Intense bouquet with classical notes: raisins, date fruit, maple syrup and spices. Friendly with nice freshness and good balance, very long and flavourful aftertaste - date fruit, walnut and maple syrup.
