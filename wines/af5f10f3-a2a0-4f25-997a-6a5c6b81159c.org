Vinu Jancu is an old Sicilian name for white wines made in an orange wine manner. This style has a deep nobility with a long history in the Eurasian production areas of Armenia & Georgia, but also found in Italy, Sicily., and other alpine areas of Europe. The white wine grapes are treated like red grapes: the juicy ferments on the grape skins and may remain sur lie long afterward, taking on more color (hence the orange), tannin, texture, and aromatics. This Vinu Jancu is made from La Crescent, a descendent of Muscat de Hambourg, and grown in the hills and valleys of Vermont. Hand-picked and hand-sorted, this honest, unfiltered wine was crushed traditionally and fermented on native yeasts at out cantina, and remained sur lie for the winter in glass demijohns.

We've been making Vinu Jancu since the beginning. Dare I say it's a flagship wine? A reserve wine, it's grown in the West Addison vineyard, on clay and limestone, on the edge of Lake Champlain, and is defined by the explosion of wild flora that grows beneath the vines, golden rod, purple aster, daisy fleabane, and wild mint.
