Made of field blend, spontaneous fermentation with indigenous yeasts in ATLAC resin vats (!) with long maceration on the skins for around 120 days. Giorgio Mercandelli releases his wines only when he thinks that they are ready for that. And it usually takes for around 5-7 years of ageing before he is happy with result.

Deep amber colour and of course it's cloudy. Powerful bouquet with secondary and tertiary notes: caramel, buckwheat honey, sweet spices, hibiscus and acetone. Full-bodied, fresh with medium-high and round tannin. Long aftertaste with flavours of buckwheat honey, quince, candied fruits and caramel. Complex, powerful and delicious skin contact wine.
