40-year-old Chardonnay have southern exposure and are planted on chalky soils that also feature chunks and pockets of a rare black flint or silex noir unique to Coteaux du Petit Morin. Pierrières was Olivier Collin's first bottling, and only bottling, in the 2004 vintage. The fruit is hand-harvested, the clusters destemmed and the grapes gently pressed; the juice is fermented spontaneously and slowly (up to six months) with natural yeasts in mainly-used Burgundy barrels. Reserve wines are held in foudres and tonneaux. The wine is bottled without fining or filtering and aged for 36 months (depends on the year and format, e.g. magnum based on 2007 was aged for 132 months).

Tasted as a part of Ulysse Collin dinner in 101 Bar.

Magnum based on 2007 (with 30% of 2006 reserve wine), it spent 132
months on lees. Expressive yet elegant bouquet: oil, toast, pear
candy, slightly baked yellow apples, plum, flowers with some cheesy
notes. Fresh and delicious.
