65-year-old Chardonnay have southern exposure and are planted on soft clay and silex topsoils over limestone. The fruit is hand-harvested, the clusters destemmed and the grapes gently pressed; the juice is fermented spontaneously and slowly (up to six months) with natural yeasts in mainly-used Burgundy barrels. Reserve wines are held in foudres and tonneaux. The wine is bottled without fining or filtering and aged for 48 months.

Tasted as a part of [[barberry:/wineries/7e4259a0-cd16-4cc8-8a06-ff3bf0c1ab46][Ulysse Collin]] dinner in 101 Bar.

I could not guess the grape here. Very interesting Chardonnay, unique
and stylish. Based on 2015, 60 months on lees. Expressive and opulent
bouquet: oil, toast, apple seeds, hay, hazelnut. Vinous, complex and
well balanced. Still young. Giving extra point for unique result (at
least in my experience).
