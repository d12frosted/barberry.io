** Producer

Arianna Occhipinti is a winemaker from Vittoria who founded her own winery in 2004, bottled her first commercial vintage in 2006 and today works exclusively with estate fruit. Her 25 hectares feature only autochthonous varieties - 50% Frappato, 35% Nero d'Avola and 15% white varieties Albanello and Zibibbo. Almost all vines are young as she planted them, most of them a guyot-trained. But she also added to her holdings 60-years-old albarello-trained vines which she initially rented.

Total production is about 10,000 cases annually.

Her uncle is Giusto Occhipinti, proprietor of Vittoria's most famous winery, [[barberry:/producers/512e0678-4812-4cee-b090-911416bcc0e2][COS]]. Arianna started at age 16 in his cellars and loved it, enough to go to oenology school and to jump right into her own production. Giusto inspired her for working in a non-bulk-driven style, using organic viticulture, picking by hand, using native-yeast fermentations. She started with 1 hectar of abandoned vines attached to a family vacation house.

Not irrigating, harvesting late and not using fertilizers are the secret to making more elegant wines in the area. The freshness and minerality in my wines come from the subsoils. Any wine made from young vines or chemically grown vines feeding only off of the top soil will have the cooked, hot characteristics people associate with wine from warm regions.

She started using Biodynamic Farming principles. There is zero irrigating in her vineyards in this hot, windy climate! Cover crops including fava beans and other useful plants grow between every other row. New plantings are massale selections only. Juice and wine are moved only by gravity. There is no new oak.

SP68 wines are vinified and aged in small concrete tanks, with no oak of any kind and no punchdowns. The red is a version of Cerasuolo di Vittoria DOCG, but with shorter aging for a fresher take on this regional signature.

Siccagno is a 100% Nero d'Avola, which is aged in old oak only. The same goes for her higher-tier Frappato only wines.

Arianna is regarded as a symbol of success in the world of Biodynamic Farming and Natural Wine Making. She has remained committed to those principles while evolving from her originally more dogmatic outlook. Below is her response to importer Jules Dressner's question about her feeling on the term "natural wine":

#+begin_quote
I make natural wine, but this is a term I'm beginning to be less and less comfortable with, because its implications are very complicated. I really want to stress that my main goal is to make a good wine that reflects where it comes from, and for me the only way to successfully do this is to make the wine naturally. When I first started, people were just starting to talk about natural wine. It was very important to me to think about all these issues, and in those early years I definitely had a more militant attitude about it. Making natural wine was a mission, something worth fighting for. Now that I've grown up a little bit, the mission is making wine of terroir. You have to respect the vineyards, and nature in general. When I wake up in the morning, I want to feel free. Making this wine is my opportunity to feel free. So again, my goal is not to make natural wine, working this way is a process to make good wine.

SP68 is a road but, it is also a young wine. Elegant brett attack after opening the bottle, it fades away bringing red currant, sour cherry and violets. Juicy and pleasant, with a delicate taste and the freshness of Sicily. Chill it a little bit and enjoy.

Well, I like this wine. Yes, you need to give it some time to get rid of sulfur compounds (otherwise smells like toiled on SP68 road). Yes, it is not mainstream. But common, it is a young, juicy and tasty wine! Cherry, white pepper and clove. Good acidity and tannins, light and refreshing. Wonderful and easy-drinking beauty from Vittoria.

The only thing I don't like about this wine is price that keeps growing. Juicy, gulpable and tasty. Cherry, white pepper, clove and clay with light brett touch. I love that with time it is settling down and become more elegant and interesting.

*** 2021-02-09 - ☆ 8.00

I have no other options except for repeating myself. Price is growing, SP68 becomes more elegant and interesting, and my love for this wine stays. Juicy, gulpable and tasty. Cherry, white pepper, clove and clay with light brett touch. Fresh, tannic. I see potential, I want to explore.

*** 2021-04-30 - ☆ 7.50

Not a secret that SP68 Rosso is one of my go-to wines, when I need something light, easy going, gastronomic and fun. Only if it would be cheaper. Brett touch, cherry, clay, white pepper. Juicy and delicious.

*** 2021-11-23 - ☆ 7.50

6 months passed since my last review and now it is more fruit-forward than before with less brett in it. Cherry, clay and white pepper. Delicate, not complex and simply delicious. Still one of my go-to wines.

*** 2021-12-02 - ☆ 7.75

My favourite 'table' wine! Slightly reductive bouquet with notes of cherry, plum, spices, blood and clay. Frappato reduced body, yet SP68 rosso is intense. Sophisticated, fresh and easy going. Mineral aftertaste with flavours of clay, violets and spiced plums.

*** 2022-07-20 - ☆ 7.75

A wine that we struggled with for the whole evening. Unexpected funkiness for such 'age'. But after decanting and finding the right temperature, it became enjoyable. And no rotten notes and fizziness. Instead, the nose is full of cherry, red apple, pomegranate, raspberry, spices, clay and blood. Medium body, intense and well balanced. Wine with character. In a good sense.
