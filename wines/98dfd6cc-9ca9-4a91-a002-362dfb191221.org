Old school bouquet full of dust, tobacco, earthy notes, red fruits, musk and subtle hints of pickles. Mature, yet I am not sure if its already on the peak or still has potential. Unexpectedly sweetish and ripe palate with mature tannin and flavours of sweet cherry, tobacco and musk. Very good, but a little bit vulgar to my taste and not sophisticated enough. Though very interesting experience to taste 17 years old Côte de Nuits.
