Tasted as part of Classy Bubbles event.

Magnum bottle. 36 months on lees. Degorgee on November 2020.

One more loud name. And again, friendly and approachable. Has more volume than Salmon, and very gastronomic. In the nose baked apple, nuts, chalk and lemon. Enjoyable, well balanced. Not reflected on the score, but liked more than Salmon.
