Pinot Noir Blind Tasting #3. Dusty and closed aroma. Sophisticated, and I am confused. Red flowers and cloves. Well balanced, but acidity is a little bit aggressive. Feels overly young. So I wonder, how much potential does it hold? I want to know answer. Obviously, Burgundy. Guess is based on dusty and sophisticated nose.
