Waaaaaaaaat? This is damn delicious, I will definitely look into buying few cases of this wine, just because (a) it's good and charming, (b) it matches this weather so well and (c) price is right. But before that I need to taste the second bottle that I have to confirm my review.

Don't get me wrong, this wine is simple, approachable with charming herbal/fruity bouquet: white cherry, yellow apple, tarragon and field flowers. Fresh, well balanced with long aftertaste, slightly bitter finish, flavours of white cherry, herbs and lemon. Quaffable, especially when chilled.
