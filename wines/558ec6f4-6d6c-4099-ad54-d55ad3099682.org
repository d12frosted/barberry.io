Waaaaaaaaat? This is damn delicious, I will definitely look into buying a case of this wine, just because (a) it's good and charming, (b) it matches this weather so well and (c) price is right. But before that I need to taste the second bottle that I have to confirm my review.

Don't get me wrong, this wine is simple, approachable with charming herbal/fruity bouquet: white cherry, yellow apple, tarragon and field flowers. Fresh, well balanced with long aftertaste, slightly bitter finish, flavours of white cherry, herbs and lemon. Quaffable, especially when chilled.

Tasted already multiple bottles, and confirm that this is a discovery. Again, it's not complex, but it still offers a wide set of distinct aromas together with an interesting palate. White cherry, green apricot, yellow apple, tarragon and white flowers. Fresh, well balanced, slightly oily with long aftertaste and nice bitter finish. Flavourful: white cherry, herbs, citrus. Nice value.
