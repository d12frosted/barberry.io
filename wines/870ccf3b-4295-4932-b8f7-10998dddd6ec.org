Pinot Noir vines were planted in 1971 in heavy, iron-rich clay soils with chalky limestone sub-soils. Hand-harvested, the clusters destemmed and the grapes gently pressed; the juice is fermented spontaneously and slowly (up to 6 months) with natural yeasts in mainly-used Burgundy barrels. Reserve wines are held in foudres and tonneaux. The wine is bottled without fining or filtering and aged on lees for 36 months.

Tasted as a part of [[barberry:/wineries/7e4259a0-cd16-4cc8-8a06-ff3bf0c1ab46][Ulysse Collin]] dinner in 101 Bar.

Based on 2016 Pinot Noir, it spent 32 months on the lees. The result
is expressive, elegant and precise. Sophisticated bouquet: cheese,
apple seeds, honey, ripe red apple with Jerez notes. Well balanced and
delicious. It is young and for sure has potential. Unfortunately,
fades away over the evening and leaves little traces of its beauty.
