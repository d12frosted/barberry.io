The image on the label screams about biodynamics, but this particular wine (unlike some others of the same producer) has only organic certification. It spent 15 months in french oak. Not sure if it's new or old, maybe tasting will reveal more information.

Lifted and expressive bouquet full of herbs, spices and medicine on a ripe cherry background. To be more specific, think of menthol, bay leaves, licorice root, nutmeg and vanilla. The most important thing to know about its taste is how it evolves - linearly gaining momentum, step by step, only to explode like a volcano. Drink slowly and enjoy this transformation, just be careful about ethanol that grows hotter and hotter and... 14.5 abv after all! Well balanced, friendly for bold-wine lovers, but at least it has something to offer. Flavourful, aside from medicines, it has liquored chocolate cherry candies in the aftertaste.

Drink now, or store for few years to come. Tannin is still firm and rough, but well integrated. And the score is mostly for this good evolution and nice bouquet.
