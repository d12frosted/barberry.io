Shy wine that lacks confidence but compensates in acidity. Still, it has some charm, especially when it comes to aroma. Red flowers, nutmeg, cherry candy, cranberry, and some meat. IMO it lacks balance, and as a result, it's hard to drink it. Maybe it comes from a single parcel called Happy Heart, but my hear is confused.
