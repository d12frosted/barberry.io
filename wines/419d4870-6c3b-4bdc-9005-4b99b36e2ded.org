The grapes for Aconcagua Costa Chardonnay are sourced from the Aconcagua Costa vineyard, planted by Viña Errázuriz in 2005 and 2009. The soil is composed of a thin layer of loamy texture and placed on a base of clay and metamorphic rock (slate/schist).

Grapes were handpicked in the early morning between March 1st and 4th in small boxes and carefully transported to the winery, where they were whole-cluster pressed and cold decanted in stainless steel tanks. The juice is then placed into used French oak barrels for fermentation, lasting 15 to 20 days. Errázuriz uses a mix of indigenous yeasts along with a number of strains, reportedly for greater complexity (?). After alcoholic fermentation, the wine undergoes 50% malolactic fermentation. Then it ages for 10 months in the same oak.
