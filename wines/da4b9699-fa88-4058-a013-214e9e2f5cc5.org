A 40-40-20 blend of Merenzao (Trousseau), Albarello (Brancellao) and Negreda (Mouratón). Made from grapes from young 20-year-old vines found between the villages of Barco de Valdeorras and Vilamartin, mostly in Córgomo. Whole clusters of each variety are gently crushed and left to macerate at low temperatures for two months in large plastic vats separately. During this time fermentation occurs initiated by indigenous yeasts. Then the wines are blended and aged for 12 months in old 3,200-litre (or 500 litre)[fn:1] French oak barrels.

[fn:1] According to [[https://www.indigowine.com/wine/eixe/][indigowine.com]], the wine was aged in big oak barrels, while according to [[https://www.europeancellars.com/wine/eixe/][europeancellars.com]], it aged in 500 litre oak barrels.

** Producer

Bodegas Peixes is the new project of the 2 guys of [[barberry:/producers/0608acc9-e36c-4cff-970e-0f2489d3011a][Fedellos do Couto]], Jesús Olivares and Curro Bareño, outside D.O. Ribeira Sacra, right in the Ourense massif, with vineyards that are exposed to the cold right to the limit where the grapes can have a good ripening. These are some of the highest vineyards in Galicia at 600-850 metres above sea level.

The 60-80 year-old gobelet trained vines grow along sinuous stone terraces. They are field blends of Mencía, Mouraton, Grao Negro, Garnacha Tintorera, Bastardo and Sousón which include 10-15% of white varietals Godello, Dona Blanca, Colgadeira and Palomino. Farming is a mix of organic and sustainable. Jesús and Curro work six hectares themselves, by hand, and with growers who manage a further two hectares. The winemaking is low intervention and constant across their three cuveés: they use whole clusters, long macerations and cool fermentations with indigenous yeasts. Wines are matured in large neutral oak and bottled without fining or filtration.

One of my favourite styles. Vivid, delicate and sophisticated red that one might mistake for an intense rose. A beautiful bouquet of barberry, rhubarb, rose water, blood and grounded white pepper. Saline and fresh mouthfeel, medium-light body and long aftertaste. Beauty! By the way, it's slightly fizzy when only opened. So aerate if you dislike this feature.
