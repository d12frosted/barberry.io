Low intervention bubbles with no chaptalisation and no correction. Powerful oxidative style that explodes with honey, wax, baked apples, almond and pickles. Such a bright style leaves no room to stay indifferent, it's a love or hate story. And while I like oxidative bubbles, this one lacks complexity and delicacy, I wonder if time will tame its raw vigor.

Oh, and it's also my first Auxerrois. Happy me.
