Black cherry, cacao, vanilla, sour cherry and leather hints. Young, but already perfectly balanced. Cacao and black cherry flavours. Long aftertaste. Love it.

Elegant and perfectly balanced wine that I would simply describe with a single word - delicious! Plume, strawberry, black cherry, hazelnut and tobacco. Smooth and flavourful.
