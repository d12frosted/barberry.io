Named after the first lamb born in the former 2Naturkinder Domina vineyard. According to the producer, 2020 was a terrible year due to the frost. Only a small amount of Domina survived, so they had to blend 57% of it with 42% of Regent (almost destroyed as well) and 1% of Pinot Meunier. Domina grapes were foot-crushed and left for one hour to macerate. Fermented and aged in old oak. Regent was fermented and aged in a stainless steel tank.
