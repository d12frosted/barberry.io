Rustic and unique style Barbera. Somehow I missed 2 previous vintages, but compared to 2016 (that I tasted more than a year ago), 2019 is less jammy. Not simple, it bursts with dark chocolate, sweat, cherry, humidor. Medium-plus body, medium-high tannin, funky and delicious. QPR is great. Aerate if you want more delicate version of this wine.

And Interesting and non typical expression of Barbera. Bursts with dark chocolate, barnyard, sweat, humidor and cherry. Good volume and balance (needs to breathe a little bit), delicious and slightly funky. QPR is good even after price adjustments.

Let's try to ignore the fact that Nadia Verrua changed the label colours to a palette that strangely reminds us of the Ukrainian flag. That happens. With time this wine calmed down and started to remind Barbera. Still with rebellious spirit in the form of dark chocolate notes, saddle and VA. Good balance, juicy and sexy stuff. She knows her craft, and that's why we love her. And for this price, it's arguably the best Barbera you can find on the market.
