Rustic and unique style Barbera. Somehow I missed 2 previous vintages, but compared to 2016 (that I tasted more than a year ago), 2019 is less jammy. Not simple, it bursts with dark chocolate, sweat, cherry, humidor. Medium-plus body, medium-high tannin, funky and delicious. QPR is great. Aerate if you want more delicate version of this wine.

Interesting and non typical expression of Barbera. Bursts with dark chocolate, barnyard, sweat, humidor and cherry. Good volume and balance (needs to breathe a little bit), delicious and slightly funky. QPR is good even after price adjustments.
