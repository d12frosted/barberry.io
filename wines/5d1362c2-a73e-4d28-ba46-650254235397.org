Tasted blind. Initially, I didn't want to finish my glass, but we drink like real men, so... I managed. It's simple in the nose. Some pear with apples and distant notes of yeasty stuff. The problem is with its taste. Not sparkling, but rather fizzy. Overly bitter aftertaste. Almost no flavours. The score is mostly for the salty finish. Or maybe I just need to stop eating salt all day along.
