Rollaball falls into one of my favourite categories - quaffable, juicy yet interesting wines. The only real issue with this wine is that it ends treacherously. Something in-between rosé and red wine. Red currant, white pepper, medicinal herbs, red apple and subtle hints of VA. Great acidity, fresh, well balanced. Aftertaste is long and delicious. No really, I just want more.

Nice, juicy and easy going wine. Wild strawberry, sour cherry, marzipan, white pepper, peach and hints of acetone. Not really red, not really rosé. Not overly complicated, but tasty and fresh medium-bodied thingy.
