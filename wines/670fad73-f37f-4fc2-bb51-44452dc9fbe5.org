Domaine du Vieux Télégraphe is a family-owned estate since 1898. La Roquète was a separate winery purchased by Daniel and Frédéric Brunier around 1986. A year later, they replanted the small 3 ha Clos La Roquète (part of 29 ha owned by La Roquète) with white grapes. Grapes are sustainably farmed and harvested by hand. They are gently pressed by pneumatic press, 25% of grapes fermented in cuve, 75% in barriques and demi-muids. Wine ages in cuve and in barrel for 8-10 months before bottling.
