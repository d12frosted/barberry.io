Ripe cherry, spices, wet logs, and gravel. Elegant and relatively light. Medium-high tannins and acidity. This wine is more enjoyable when chilled a little bit. Flavourful, wet logs, sour cherry and spices. Long and evolving aftertaste. I actually think that this wine is not ready yet. Still a little bit green.
