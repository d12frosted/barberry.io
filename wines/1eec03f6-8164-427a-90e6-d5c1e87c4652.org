The Classic Cuv√©e is a blend of Pinot Noir (81%) and Chardonnay (19%) from Crouch Valley Vineyard (Maldon, Essex). The grapes are picked by hand and pressed whole-cluster. The fermentation started after a slow, cold and natural settle, partially in oak barriques (33%) and in stainless steel (67%). In the following spring, the wine is blended and bottled for the second fermentation. It remained on lees for a minimum of 24 months.
