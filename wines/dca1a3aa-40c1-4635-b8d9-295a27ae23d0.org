This wine was advertised as an example of heavy New World style, but I could not agree as this Pinot Noir is quite elegant, well balanced and velvety. Yes, it is not complex, it is young but well made nevertheless. Bouquet features red fruits, mostly ripe cherry, cola and some spices from oak. QPR is questionable, of course, but for me it was interesting as it is my first Pinot Noir from USA.
