After tasting basic Marcel Lapierre Morgon, I was expecting a little bit more from Jean Foillard. Still, it was delicate, good and easy going Morgon with a strain. Blueberry, plum, cherry blossom and subtle hints of VA. Medium-light, lacks structure and complexity. Flavours of mulberry.

The tasting notes were lost due to some catastrophe. No way to resurrect them.
