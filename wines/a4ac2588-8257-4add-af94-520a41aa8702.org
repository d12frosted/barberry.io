№2 Victoria is 100% Muscat of Alexandria. The oldest variety in the Muscat family and one of the few remaining genetically unmodified Vitis vinifera cultivars remaining in the world today. The Phoenicians transplanted this grape from Alexandria (Egypt) to Málaga (Spain) approximately 2,800 years ago.

The grapes come from the following vineyards: Frontilla, Panderón, Navarrete, Villazo, and Villalto. Vines are planted between 1902 and 1935. Traditional dry-farmed viticulture. Cultivated completely by hand, with minimal human intervention. The majority of the vines receive no treatments whatsoever. Many of the vineyards are planted directly into the rock (slate) immediately after the phylloxera.

Late-harvest (partially dehydrated) bunches are whole-cluster pressed in a pneumatic press. Fermentation occurs in small (1,500L) stainless steel tanks. When fermentation reaches 10% alcohol, the temperature of the tank is dropped dramatically to halt fermentation. A small amount of SO2 is added to stop fermentation. Then the wine is aged for 8 months sur lie in stainless steel.

Fun fact. 4.5 kg of grapes are required to create just one bottle (375 ml). What a feast.

Neat sweet wine. An attractive bouquet of candied fruits, lemon, white flowers, mould, sea and pine nuts. Surprisingly good acidity for a wine with 186 g/L of residual sugar. It also has a low alcohol level (10 abv). It's well-structured and has a long aftertaste with flavours of citrus, pine nuts and blue cheese. A liquid dessert we all deserve.
