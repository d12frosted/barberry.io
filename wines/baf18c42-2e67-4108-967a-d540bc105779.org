Unexpected gem. I found it by accident, lost behind a wall of mediocre crowd-pleasing Champagne labels. Based on 2009, spent at least 60 months on lees. Sunflower oil, baked apples, toast and amber. Well balanced, good balance and volume with long and persistent aftertaste. Despite age it's still vigorous. Look, it's not a masterpiece, but definitely worth checking and buying again.
