Compared to previous vintage, 2019 has less oak notes and more citrus
stuff. Pear, lemon, hazelnut and melon. Great slightly butter-ish
structure, fresh, with neat lemon finish.

One of my favourite Israeli wines. Easy to understand, yet has multiple layers to offer. Good combination of secondary and primary aromas - stone fruits, citrus, vanilla and butter. Oak is here and is well integrated, and less pronounced than in previous vintage. Dry, medium-full bodied, fresh and absurdly flavourful - popcorn, citrus, bakery and butter. Seems like Golan Highest Winery is on the right path.
