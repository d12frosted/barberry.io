Traditional sparkling from Argentina made of Champagne grapes. That the story behind this purchase. Crowd-pleasing bubbles full of crème brûlée and brioche. Lacks acidity, too sweet for my taste. I was trying to play with temperature, but with no avail. I either got a creamy desser with pleasant foam, or restrained stingy apple/pear story. So... interesting, but not going to buy anything else from Chandon (unless I am on an island and it's the only wine around).
