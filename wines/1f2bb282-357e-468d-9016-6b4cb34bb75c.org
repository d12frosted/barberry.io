What a beautiful and sophisticated old-school style. Fried sunflower seeds, wet wood, mushrooms, subtle notes of pickles, freshly cut green walnut (e.g. iodine). There are red fruits, but on the back and in small quantities. Well preserved and lively. Almost perfectly balanced, high acidity, medium and mature tannin, elegant and elevated. And most importantly, it's just delicious.
