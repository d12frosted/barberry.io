A bit shy and not convincing. A glass of this wine and it's like nothing happened. Anyways, it's fresh, clean (despite the talk about 'natural' wine-making), racy and balanced. Perlage is weak, which can be a good thing for some people. The bouquet is quite simple - notes of green apple, citrus and cookies. Need to retry.
