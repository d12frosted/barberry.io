45-year-old Chardonnay have eastern exposure and are planted on clay and silex topsoils over limestone. The fruit is hand-harvested, the clusters destemmed and the grapes gently pressed; the juice is fermented spontaneously and slowly (up to six months) with natural yeasts in mainly-used Burgundy barrels. Reserve wines are held in foudres and tonneaux. The wine is bottled without fining or filtering and aged for 48 months.

Tasted as a part of [[barberry:/wineries/7e4259a0-cd16-4cc8-8a06-ff3bf0c1ab46][Ulysse Collin]] dinner in 101 Bar.

Based on 2014, it spent 60 months on lees. The most friendly and quaffable wine of the evening, in a very good sense. Multilayered bouquet: you have salty cheese, cream soda, toast, apple seeds and pear. Everything is well combined and creates wonderful volume. Complex, perfectly balanced, evolving, elegant and delicious. Again, it is subjectively, but I loved this wine.
