Well made and typical Blanc de Blancs. Apple, lemon, cream, bakery and a little bit of oil. Well balanced wine with long finish and flavours of lemon, yeast, sunflower oil and shell touch. Easy going, friendly.

BdB Dinner #1. Around a month ago I've already tasted this wine, so it was interesting to see how it fits into range of other BdBs. Straight-forward and pleasant to drink. Lemon, cream soda, ripe pear, honey and touch of oil. Not complex, but well balanced with wonderful texture and long aftertaste.

Beautiful and straightforward BdBs. Lemon, cream soda, honey, oil - all on the canvas made of ripe pear and apple. Not complex but quaffable thanks to almost perfect balance, higher acidity and a long aftertaste. Consistently good.
