Well made and typical Blanc de Blancs. Apple, lemon, cream, bakery and a little bit of oil. Well balanced wine with long finish and flavours of lemon, yeast, sunflower oil and shell touch. Easy going, friendly.

BdB Dinner #1. Around a month ago I've already tasted this wine, so it was interesting to see how it fits into range of other BdBs. Straight-forward and pleasant to drink. Lemon, cream soda, ripe pear, honey and touch of oil. Not complex, but well balanced with wonderful texture and long aftertaste.
