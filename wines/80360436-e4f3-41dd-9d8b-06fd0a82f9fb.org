You don't expect much from an $8 wine, so it's always refreshing when such wines deliver. Of course, it's not complex. Of course, it has minor issues. But look, it makes a decent pair for a lazy evening after work. Peach, grapefruit, grass, and gooseberry. On the palate, it's round and more voluminous than I would expect. Intense and fresh. It has pleasant mineral touch and flavours of lime, peach and gooseberry with a less pleasant bitterness. The aftertaste could be longer, but well...
