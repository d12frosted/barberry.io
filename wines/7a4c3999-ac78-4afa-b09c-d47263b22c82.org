San Lorenzo is set outside Randazzo on the lower slopes of the volcano, 700 to 800 meters above sea level. The contrada is named after the cult of St. Lawrence. The wine is a blend of Nerello Mascalese with a tiny bit of Nerello Cappuccio. The 70 to 100 years old vines grow on volcanic (who would guess?) and sandy soils rich in minerals. Spontaneously fermented with indigenous yeasts. Macerated for 15 days and aged for 18 months in used 2600L oak casks. A relatively tiny production, only 4000 bottles yearly.

** Producer

#+begin_quote
Making wine on the slopes of Mount Etna is an intensely personal, profound and ongoing act of love.
#+end_quote

Some are just 'lucky' to be affiliated with Etna by the right of birth. Giuseppe Russo, a graduate of Humanities with a Diploma in piano, re-established the family winery in 2005 and dedicated it to the memory of the late father, Girolamo. Their vineyards cover 18 hectares, surrounded by hazelnut and olive groves.

Giuseppe Russo owns around 26 ha of vineyards, half is sold, half is turned into wine. 1 white, 1 ros√© and 4 red wines.
