Tasted blind. Great and expressive BdN (100% Pinot Noir). Notes of oxidation, yellow apple, crème brûlée, brioche, cider, baked apple. Wonderful acidity, well balanced and quite delicate on the palate despite being almost full-bodied. Flavourful and long aftertaste with lots of cider in the taste. Opens up in the glass, good to drink in a small company (or alone haha) to enjoy its evolution.
