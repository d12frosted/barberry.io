Beautiful and delicate bouquet. Cherry, cranberry, strawberry, red flowers with some chocolate and earthy hints. Silky, balanced, nuanced and sexy. Very young, would love to drink it again in few years. Unlike many other 2018 wines of this region, it is not overripe. So far, Rossignol-Trapet is one of my favourite domains from Côte d'Or.
