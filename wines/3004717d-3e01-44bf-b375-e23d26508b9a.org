A bottle that you definitely notice on the shelve thanks to these catchy labels. A wide range of wines with little available information. Even the looks of the content tell about the style. And indeed, Anton Gerrard van Klopper is a convinced naturalist.

Before starting his own winery, Anton worked in hospitality for 10 years, where he became interested in wines. He was curious: why did he like some wines more than others. There are many possible reasons, so he headed off to the University of Adelaide to complete a degree in oenology.

For a few years after completing his degree, Anton travelled the world to gain valuable experience by working with other winemakers he respected. He slowly started to form his philosophy. It is typical for low intervention winemakers, but the year was 2002. You could not learn it from Google or university books.

So, in 2002, Anton found a cherry orchard in Peramangk Country in the beautiful Basket Range area of the Adelaide Hills, South Australia. At the time, the Adelaide Hills was renowned as one of Australia’s premier cool-climate regions, with a growing reputation for Chardonnay, Shiraz and sparkling wines. It took some time for this region to become a hub for organic and biodynamic viticulture. And Anton played his part in this quest by convincing others to change the ways of farming.

The most challenging part of natural winemaking is to live with the naysayers who choose recipe over craft.

Anton walked a path from renegade to trailblazer for Adelaide Hills, and now he can focus on his craft. Ha, if only it would be so simple. Remember that he worked in hospitality before starting a winery? In 2016 together with Jasper Button from Commune of Buttons, he opened a wine bar in the nearby hamlet of Summertown. The **Summertown Aristologist** gives Anton the freedom to treat people with wines and foods of his making. It turns out he never gave up on his culinary skills. And now, two of his crafts sing a single song.

This Shiraz is not my thing. Mostly because it's not integral. It has two states. First one is overly dizzy something that has little to no flavour and powerful acidity. Second one comes after some aeration. It's a compote made of cranberry, guelder rose and darker berries. I definitely like the second state more, especially due to funny aroma of guelder rose and flavours of strawberry and spices (I wonder if it spent time in older and big barrels). But this state is rather simple and one-sided. So overall it's ok, I enjoy it's acidity (keep in mind that it's Australia), but I'd wait for a year in hopes for it to become whole. Also it could be a bottle variation, which is no wonder...
