A wine that I would gladly drink somewhere on a tropical island, enjoying the view and tranquillity. It would help to bear the heat thanks to high acidity and not make me overly dizzy thanks to the low alcohol level. I would not need to strain my brain as the bouquet is simple and matches the surroundings: lime, hints of pineapple and wet stone. The aftertaste is short, but it suffices. So this wine is not complex, watery and pleasant.
