Tasted blind and didn't guess. My ideas were floating around low intervention Crémants, possibly from Jura or Alsace. Funny, but I was the only person that felt powerful Fino notes in this wine with hints of mushrooms and smeared yellow apples. And since I love these aromas, it settled my decision. Objectively it's not complex. It lacks volume and acidity; it drops in the end, but it's well-made. Subjectively, this is something I would love to drink again.
