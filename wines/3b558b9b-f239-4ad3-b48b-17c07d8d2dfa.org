Unexpectedly deep colour. Very expressive (but not as sexy as Jean Grivot wines). Dominant oak, sour cherry, red flowers, pickles and animal notes. Powerful and rustic palate, though well structured. Seems like it has a huge potential, can't believe it's already 13 years old! For my taste it lacks elegance and complexity. High rating is partially because of potential.
