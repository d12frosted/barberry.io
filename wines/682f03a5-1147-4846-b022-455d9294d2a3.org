The 2018 Collio is a blend of Friulano (70%), Ribolla Gialla (15%) and Malvasia Istriana (15%) from 40-year-old vines. The wine is a testament to the very land Edi Keber holds dear. Structure from Friulano grown on the hill of Zeglar, freshness from Ribolla Gialla and aromatics from Malvasia. The grapes ferment in cement tanks and then aged in the same tanks for at least 5 months.

** Producer

Edi Keber is a notable Italian winemaker known for producing high-quality wines in the Collio area of the Friuli Venezia Giulia region of northeastern Italy. His commitment to quality and tradition continues to contribute to the region's reputation for producing outstanding white wines. His winemaking philosophy emphasizes minimal intervention in the vineyard and cellar, allowing the grapes to express their full potential and the unique characteristics of the Collio region.

While Edi Keber first began producing bottled wines in 1957, his family enjoyed a much longer history with winemaking, with some records stating that members of the Keber family were making wines as many as 350 years ago.

Edi Keber maintains 12 hectares of vineyards on the "ponka" soil full of stony marl. The winery is recognized for its skilful handling of the Friulano grape variety. They also grow other varietals, including Malvasia Istriana, Ribolla Gialla, and Merlot.
