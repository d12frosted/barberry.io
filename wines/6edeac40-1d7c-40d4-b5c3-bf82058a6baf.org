The colour already reveals the age. Yet, in the nose, it's pretty lively: bruised cherry, red flowers, pepper, dust tar notes and tomato stem. It slightly lacks balance: tannin is still rough, and the bitterness in the finish is offsetting. But overall, it's good: it still has juice and fruit, and the aftertaste is long and jammy.
