Well yes, it's an absolute blockbuster, but kind of in a good way. Nice nose featuring plums, graphite, spices, medicinal herbs with hints of menthol. Almost full-bodied, well structured and balanced wine with the right volume. Still very young with fruit-forward profile and long aftertaste. Potential? Few years for sure, but already a pleasure to drink it now.

Nothing really changed since my last tasting of this wine. Licorice root, plums, menthol and spices. Still young, fruit-forward profile yet velvety with good balance and long aftertaste. Hard to drink solo, pairs well with meat snacks.
