Wonderful, serious and demanding rosé. Elegant bouquet of honey, cream, baked apple, strawberry, grapefruit peel with subtle hints of caramel and raisins. Perfectly balanced, fresh with minimal oak influence (and it's actually 100 years old oak influence). Definitely my type of rosé.

Wine #6 on Rose Petals Party.
