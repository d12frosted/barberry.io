** Producer

La Stoppa is a legendary historic estate that was founded in 19th century by a lawyer named Giancarlo Ageno. Initially focused on Bordeaux varieties, nowadays its vineyards are occupied by local Barbera, Bonarda and Malvasia. Elena Pantaleoni, current owner of the estate, works closely with famous enologist Giulio Armani (that has his own side project called [[barberry:/producers/53e31c1f-70b3-4504-897d-fe020167f48c][Denavolo]]) to craft wines expressive of place and grape. They are advocates of minimal intervention along with usage of huge Slavonian oak botti and used French barriques. Also they are farming organically since 1990's and in 2008 they even acquired proper certification.

Dried fruits, meat, blackberry and mulberry. High tannin, acidity is medium+. Complex and developed wine.

*** 2020-03-04 - ☆ 9.00

What a wonderful wine. It has a colour of pomegranate skin. In the nose, it's an explosion of prunes, spices, vanilla, mushrooms, underbrush, medicinal herbs, syrup and blackberry jam. Almost full-boded, tannin is powerful and developed. Good acidity. The aftertaste is long.

Perfect finish for the evening. Ipadri opens up with prune, dried black fruits, rotten black berries, meat and cigars. Powerful taste with high tannins and good acidity. Flavours of cigar smoke and black berries. Nice!

Ipadri, Merlot from interesting producer. Wine is fading and it's already past it's peak. Jam, fig, clove and sweat. Still good, but not as good as it was even half a year ago. Still good value.

P.S. Be careful, as it has lot's of big particles.
