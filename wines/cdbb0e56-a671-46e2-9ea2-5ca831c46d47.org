It's not everyday that I drink a 15 years old rosé. That is also in a good shape with potential to age for more years. Old school style, complex and interesting bouquet of caramel, marzipan, apricot, blood orange and fig with some cooked notes. In a blind tasting (sniffing?) I would assume that it has some relation to Madeira wine, but then you taste it and it's bone dry and not fortified. And the acidity is high. Overall, I love this wine and it feels like a cherry on a cake.
