Beautiful, sexy and expressive bouquet full of flowers and wild strawberries, mushrooms, animal notes, jamon and balsamic notes. Juicy, quaffable and well balanced with long aftertaste. Great compromise between complexity and approachability. Maybe I am drunk already, but IMHO this wine deserves such a high score.
