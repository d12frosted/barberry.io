Interesting blend of Inzolia with Sauvignon Blanc, a pair of grapes for a wine called 'golden wedding' dedicated to 50 year anniversary of Count Giuseppe Tasca d’Almerita with his wife Franca. Slightly tropical bouquet mixed with citrus, pebbles and honeycomb. Fresh, good volume, long evolving aftertaste with nice slightly bitter finish. Flavours evolve from stone fruits with pineapple and lemon juice to honey and then end up with some hazelnut notes. Sounds more exciting than in reality, but it's good.
