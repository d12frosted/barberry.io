Obvious ageing on lees thanks to notes of cheese and yeast that smells like cheese (bloody hell, why do I know how this edible yeast smells?). Add flowers, stone fruits, yellow apples and lack of freshness. Luckily, in this century we have ACs. But it has good volume and a long aftertaste. My only complaint is regarding balance. Other than this, it's a simple, pleasant wine that matches well with Asian food.
