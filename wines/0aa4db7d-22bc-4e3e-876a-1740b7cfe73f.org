Something has happened to this wine. Either it was spoiled or served improperly. So I gave it more time to open up and while experience drastically improved, this Chenin Blanc still had plenty of unpleasanties. Nevertheless, expressive and rich bouquet full of brown ale, baked apples, wax, and bread. Sounds interesting, isn't it? But it's harsh on the palate with overwhelming feeling of eating apple seeds without apple. So instead of a wine I've got a glass of brown ale.
