Tasted blind and didn't guess. My bet was on natural Germany, but turned out to be Marsannay! Bouquet that evolves with time. At the beginning it is very reductive with cosmic amount of butter hiding everything except for pomelo skin and meringue. But then reductive stuff goes away, butter becomes less aggressive, revealing grass, green unripe apricot, bakery, violets. Yes, it turns into beautiful wine. Fresh, well balanced. If it wasn't for aggressive oak, could get better score.
