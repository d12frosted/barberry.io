Didn't expect to get a 6 years old Zweigelt. Simple yet good wine. Red berries, lots of cranberry, spices and pine. Well balanced, a little bit stingy. Great value!

This bottle is from recent supply that came after the storage was destroyed. Amazing value for 7 years old Zweigelt that shows development and still has potential. Simple yet charming bouquet of red berries like sour cherry and cranberry mixed with smoked notes. It's not a blockbuster, but rather austere beauty. Juicy and vigorous with long aftertaste and flavours of smoked cherry. Good house wine.
