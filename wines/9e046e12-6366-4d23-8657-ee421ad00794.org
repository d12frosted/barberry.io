Grapes are harvested between the first week of September and the second week of October. This
sparkling wine is made of main red varieties Pinot Noir, Zweigelt and St Laurent. These grapes are
sourced from different chalky parcels in our vineyards which lends the wine freshness and while most
of the sites are southeast facing slopes, the wine also receives warmth. The harvested grapes are
transported in small cases directly into the cellar, where they are very gently and carefully
pressed. Only the heart of the must is used for the sparkling production.

The base wines of the individual grape varieties were vinified separately and went through
malolactic fermentation. Subsequently, the cuvée was produced (with the somewhat more powerful
charges of the Zweigelt used for the still rosé wine).

The base cuvée is vinified in the bottle in classic fashion by adding sugar and yeast after bottling
and gets 18 - 24 months yeast contact before the process of remuage. After prolonged elevation on
the yeast the bottles are disgorged.

4.0 Amazing traditional sparkling from Austria. 2 years on lees. Wild
strawberry, nuts, toast bread. Refreshing, long and evolving aftertaste.
Flavours of cream and wild strawberries. Wonderful Champagne alternative. I am
impressed.

Amazing traditional sparking rosé. Cheese popcorn, wild red berries,
and toast bread. Refreshing with long and evolving aftertaste, creamy
texture with red currant flavours. Nice.

We had a Rosé Petals Party (just a respectable name for a rosé wine
binge). And what a party without sparkling? When it comes to rosé,
Bründlmayer beats this price segment and can be compared to basic
Champagne in terms of what you get. Not simple, but easy going and
enjoyable. Fistful of strawberries, wild red berries, toast and
popcorn. Sharp and refreshing.

Rose Sparkling wine tasting event at Goodwine TSUM.

Great as always. It's definitely my go to sparkling rosé when I want
some (and I rarely do). Wild strawberries, red currant, cream, cherry,
toast. Well balanced, good acidity, wonderful mousse with ripe red
currant flavours.

Constantly delivers. One of my favourite rosé sparkling wines. Nice combination of red berries like red currant and toasty notes. Sharp, refreshing, well balanced with long aftertaste.
