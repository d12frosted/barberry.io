Quite simple, but well made Sauvignon Blanc from Leyda Valley. Honestly, didn't expect it to be that good. Kiwi, pineapple, ripe gooseberry in the nose. Flavours of ripe gooseberry and wet stones. Good acidity, fresh and crisp. Good rating is mostly for presence of focus and freshness. Second bottle taught me that it has to be well chilled.
