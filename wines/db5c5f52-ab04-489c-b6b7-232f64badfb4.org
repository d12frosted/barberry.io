Tasted blind and though about Jura or some natural Australia. Nice subtle flor aromas: Jerez, pine nuts and smoke. In addition it features butter, reductive stuff, dust and yellow apples. Not sure how producer got combination of flor and reductive aromas in one wine, but it's cool. Fresh and interesting evolving taste, long aftertaste.
