Pompous and expressive crowd pleaser. Lots of cured meat, coffee beans, and black fruits. Goes well with food or situations when wine is just a background (though the last phrase sounds sad). Good QPR. Thanks to quite the amount of residual sugar, can be a window into the world of dry wines for those who strictly ignore them.

Consistent crowd pleaser. This time it has less cured meat, more fruits and mocha with chocolate powder. Almost full-bodied, fruity, well-balanced and easy to understand. A wine to use as a bridge from cocktails to finer stuff.
