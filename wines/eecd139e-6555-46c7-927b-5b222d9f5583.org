Tasted blind. Vulgar and unfocused. Tropical fruits, passion fruit, pineapple, pear candy and green unripe apricot. Long bitter aftertaste, feels off-dry, flavours of tropical fruits and green unripe apricot. In the beginning it was even fizzy. But with time it gets more calm and you also get lilac flowers added to bouquet. Overall, it was a very strange experience and everyone marked is as the least loved wine of the evening. Now imagine how shocked we were after revealing the bottles.
