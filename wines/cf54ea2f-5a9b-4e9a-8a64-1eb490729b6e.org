In love with Bedel wines. Rich, complex and so yummy. Oxidative notes, baked apples, Jerez and lemon tart. While being powerful, it is not heavy, and well balanced.

Lovely expressive and oxidative Bedel-style. Baked apples with honey, toast, pear, roasted nuts, Jerez, lemon tart, oil. Sophisticated, but friendly and approachable, rich and powerful. Delicious as hell.

Tasted as part of Divych Vechir event.
