Blend of Grenache and Macabeo, no wonder it's something in-between red and rosé wine. Cloudy deep copper colour. Youthful and aromatic bouquet. Peach, acetone, white plum and tea. Medium bodied, fresh, round and medium tannin, almost perfectly balanced, long and flavourful aftertaste. Acetone and peach ice tea on the palate. Delicious and sophisticated wine.
