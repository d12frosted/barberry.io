Tasted blind. Since the list of white wines was known to me, the guess is obvious here. On the other hand, based on my tasting experience, I would think about some aged Chenin Blanc from Loire. Charming bouquet with nice machinery notes, quince jam, butter. Amazing acidity despite age with long finish and flavours of lemon juice and croissant with butter. Experience is rather thin as it lacks volume.
