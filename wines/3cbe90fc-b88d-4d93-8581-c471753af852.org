A 60/40 blend of Pinot Noir and Chardonnay sourced equally from La Rivière, La Montagne and La Côte vineyards. The main crus (see the map) are Verzenay, Verzy, Beaumont-sur-Vesle, Ay, Avize, Mesnil-sur-Oger and Cramant. None of the wine went through malolactic. Around one-third was vinified in wood.
