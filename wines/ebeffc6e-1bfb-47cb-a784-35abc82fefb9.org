The 2015 Bianco Trebež is a blend of Pinot Grigio, Chardonnay and Sauvignon Blanc. The grapes are sourced from 35-year-old vines. Each variety is fermented and macerated separately in open vats. Pinot Grigio spends 8 days in contact with skins, while the other grapes macerate for 18 days before being assembled and aged in large oak barrels for up to 3 years.

** Producer

Dario Prinčič formed the winery in 1993. Before that, the family was selling grapes to other wineries in the region. In six years, Dario started to experiment with maceration for white wines. This gave wines such complexity and texture, which Dario loved so much that he decided to macerate the whole production the following year.

Today, the family owns 10 hectares of densely planted vines on the soil composed of clay and sandstone.

There are no ratings of this wine yet. It's waiting for the right moment, which could be today, tomorrow or even in a year. Or maybe, I am drinking it at this moment... So stay tuned!
