I feared it would be a shitty wine. This expectation is based on my previous encounters with Pheasant's Tears. But you know, it was actually tasty with an interesting twist. Made of 417 grapes, it still has a recognisable origin. Prune, cherry, walnut and dry autumn leaves. Powerful tannin, even after 3 hours of decanting. Juicy, with a nice mineral touch. Overall it's not complex, just a pleasant drink with an interesting story behind it.

Tasted as part of [[barberry:/posts/2022-07-05-mixed-bag][Mixed Bag Vol. 1]].
