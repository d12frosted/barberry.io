Brichet is made of 95% Glera and 5% Verdiso blend that come from a tiny (0.25-hectare) plot of the same name. These are old, steeply terraced vines on white, stony, limestone-y, scrappy soils that lie outside of the Valdobbiaddene DOCG, hence the IGP Colli Trevigiani classification. The plot was acquired in 2008.

They use a pneumatic press to... well, press the grapes. Gently and slowly. The must is partially fermented in the cold cellar. And then the sweet must is separated from the still juice using a paper filter. And then there is a reunion date happening in the winter to get bubbles. There is no disgorgement, so there is sediment in the bottle, making a fine old-fashioned Col Fondo Prosecco. But most importantly, these lees cells add complexity over time.

** Producer

Casa Coste Piane is located in Valdobbiadene sub-region of Prosecco. And imagine! Loris Follador got this farm with 60+ years old vines and winemaking techniques from his father, who in turn got this all from his father. Loris Follador is a lucky guy with a fortunate legacy. Somehow this family ignored all the 'improvements' from the 60s, so they don't meddle much with vines and wines.

** Ratings

There are no ratings of this wine yet. It's waiting for the right moment, which could be today, tomorrow or even in a year. Or maybe, I am drinking it at this moment... So stay tuned!
