Brichet is made of 95% Glera and 5% Verdiso blend that come from a tiny (0.25-hectare) plot of the same name. These are old, steeply terraced vines on white, stony, limestone-y, scrappy soils that lies outside of the Valdobiaddene DOCG, hence the IGP Colli Trevigiani classification. The plot was acquired in 2008.

They use pneumatic press to... well, press the grapes. Gently and slowly. The must is partially fermented in the cold cellar. And then the sweet must is separated from still juice using paper filter. And then there is a reunion date happening in the winter in order to get bubbles. There is no disgorgement, so there is sediment in the bottle, making a fine old-fashioned col fondo Prosecco. But most importantly, these lees cells add complexity over time.
