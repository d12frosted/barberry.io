Wonderful medium-full bodied blend of Cabernet Sauvignon, Merlot and Carménère from respected winery. Already showing complexity at this age, still has potential. As with many wines of this region, Terre di San Leonardo has high acidity, but lacks in tannin to get right volume. Regardless, it's delicious with long persistent aftertaste.
