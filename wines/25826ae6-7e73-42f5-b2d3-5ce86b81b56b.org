Very good Sauvignon Blanc that mixes tropical features with yeasty funky stuff. As they say, entry-level 'natural' wine. So expect mango, passion fruit, bakery and pear cidre. Fresh and pretty focused. It's slightly dizzy and in addition to flavours of pear it only magnifies impression of pear cidre. Add some salty lemon notes and hear my conclusion - niiiiice.
