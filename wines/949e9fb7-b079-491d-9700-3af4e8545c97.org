Amazing blanc de blancs from Jura. Slightly baked apples, ice cream, flowers, crème brûlée and toasts. Creamy texture, fresh and delicious. Perfect choice for easy going evening, when you want to relax, but still enjoy well made sophisticated bubbles.

Tasted as part of Chefs dinner in 101 Bar.

Delicious as ever. Ice cream, crème brûlée, candied pear, baked apple, and Jerez notes. Well balanced, creamy texture combined with good acidity and overall dessert palate results in a sparkling ice cream! Friendly, swallowable and precise.

Tasted as part of Classy Bubbles event.

Good as always and (unexpectedly) stable. And delicious as ever. Ice
cream, candied pear, apple with Jerez notes. Well balanced, creamy
texture, almost a liquid dessert. Very friendly, and easy going. The
only problem is rising price.

One of my mothers favorite bubbles. As good as always, and quite consistent (unlike my rating). It's an ice cream with waffles in a liquid form. Add some Jerez notes together with pear lollipop and voilà! You've got a wonderful crémant. Almost perfectly balanced, great structure, creamy with a long aftertaste. Delicious.
