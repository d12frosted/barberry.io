Nerello Mascalese from Eduardo Torres Acosta. Grapes grow on the North Side of mount Etna on 750-950m altitude. Cherry, bonfire smoke, undergrowth, heap of autumn leaves. Tasty and flavourful. Sweet cherry dominates. Round and well balanced with medium+ acidity and medium tannin. Drinkable and understandable. This wine is a noble sweet cherry with some wild roots. Definitely worth trying.
