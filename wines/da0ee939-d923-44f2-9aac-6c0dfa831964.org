Clear medium ruby colour. Youthful classical yet restrained bouquet with beautiful notes of cherry, wild strawberry, forest floor, peonies, dust and hints of figs. Crisp, medium body, medium-high tannin. Well balanced, flavourful with very long aftertaste. Delicate and juicy, very young and charged for the years to come.
