At first Grappoli del Grillo was a huge disappointment until I changed my glass from universal to aroma collector. That was a game changer. We might argue that a great wine should deliver no matter the glass, but I don't agree with that statement (comment section please). Delicate and sophisticated. Iodine, lime, lemon zest and camomile. Shows character, long evolving aftertaste with flavours of camomile and lime soaked in sea.
