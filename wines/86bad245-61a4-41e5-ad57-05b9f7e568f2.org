** Producer

Stanko Radikon is a legendary farmer and winemaker from a legendary region. He and his friends ([[barberry:/producers/bd1ae49f-3ec6-4701-b633-832d29f929f8][Gravner]]) started period of renaissance for amber wines - white wines with extended skin maceration. But of course, in town of Oslavia it was called "Slovenian" or "Friuli" style - hand-harvesting, skin contact, large and older barrel fermentation without any temperature control, no added yeasts or enzymes, and little to no use of sulfur.

The vineyards were originally planted in the beginning of XX century by Stanko’s grandfather Franz Mikulus with the local favorite, the Ribolla Gialla grape. And basically, Stanko went back to the ways his grandfather was producing wines back in 30s.

After Stanko passing away in 2016, his son Saša took the winery in his hands. Though people say that nothing has really changed in the philosophy of Radikon winery as Saša has been helping out since he was a kid and a partner since 2006.

[[barberry:/posts/2023-02-07-on-the-collio-hills][On the Collio Hills]], wine #4.

It's hard to keep up in such a challenging lineup, and IMO, Jakot manages. It's not as complex as Ribolla (both of them, actually), but it's still a great wine. Fresh bouquet of slightly spoiled citrus (mix of pomelo with grapefruit), VA, field flowers (mostly fresh), toffee and buckwheat honey. A good amount of funkiness, just to spice things up a little bit. Fresh and juicy with a long aftertaste.
