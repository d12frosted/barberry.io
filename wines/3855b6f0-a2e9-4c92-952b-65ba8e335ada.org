This is the case when I am not sure if the wine is too complex or just flabby. Buttered croissant with vanilla, chalk, apples, oxidative notes, and pickles. The acidity is as sharp as a well-cared knife (e.g. not mine). Which is nice, but it lacks volume. The flavour is full of pickled lemons. Good, but there are definitely better things in this price range.
