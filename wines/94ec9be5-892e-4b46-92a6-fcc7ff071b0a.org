Very fresh and enjoyable wine. Strawberry, raspberry, leaves of black currant, hints of spices and jam. It's important to give it some time to breath, so it won't disappoint you.

It is still as youthful as it was few months ago. Simple, but so gulpable and juicy, balanced and just well made wine full of strawberries, raspberries and vanilla.

*** 2022-09-16 - ☆ 7.75

Lovely as ever. Who would expect a blend of Pinotage and Cinsault to be so elegant, juicy and balanced? Well, made by a good winery (a project by Hamilton Russell) in a good climate. Cherry candy, cranberry, withering flowers, hibiscus, and smokey notes. Still fresh and still has gunpowder to survive a few years more. A companion to stay by. Not complex, yet attractively delicious.
