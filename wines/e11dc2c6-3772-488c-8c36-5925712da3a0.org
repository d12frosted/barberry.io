This 73/27 blend of Roussanne and Viognier from Upper Galilee offers an intense and quite sophisticated bouquet. A nice mix of citrus, stone fruits, buttered croissants, and citrus oil. The medium-high body is balanced; it has decent acidity and oily texture with a long and flavourful aftertaste. Still green yet delicious.
