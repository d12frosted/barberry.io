Expected more from Premier Cru bottle, nose is restrained, but typical. Creamy, fresh, with good acidity, goes wonderfully with seafood.

I remember my previous experience with this wine. But decided to give it another try. This time it's better but still disappointing. Food Champagne. The only "interesting" part is notes of pickles, but it's a matter of taste.
