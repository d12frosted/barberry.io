A month and a half has passed since our last Barberry Garden event. And if you think I used this time to reflect on the past and plan the future, you are absolutely wrong. I played FFXIV[fn:1] and visited a bunch of wine-tasting events organised by Vova, Mykola, Roman and Elena (for example, [[barberry:/posts/2023-08-25-bourgogne][Bourgogne Party]], [[barberry:/posts/2023-09-07-sicily][Sicily]], [[barberry:/posts/2023-09-21-champagne][Champagne Party]] and [[barberry:/posts/2023-09-28-friuli][Notorious Friuli]]). Now that I decided to leave the cave I'd been sitting in, I asked chat GPT - 'what would be the best topic for our 21st event?'. After some delay (v3.5 is darn slow), it concluded that Mixed Bag is the best choice. 'Should I bring a bottle of Champagne?' - I continued. 'Of course, Champaign is always a great choice', Chat GPT persuaded me.

So hear me out. Between two evenings dedicated to Sicily focused on specific producers ([[barberry:/posts/2023-08-15-occhipinti][Arianna Occhipinti]] and Gulfi), let's unpack the Pandora box (my backpack) and learn the joy of the unknown.

How to read this table:

- =rms= is root mean square or quadratic mean. The problem with arithmetic mean is that it is very sensitive to deviations and extreme values in data sets, meaning that even single 5 or 1 might 'drastically' affect the score.
- =sdev= is standard deviation. The bigger this value the more controversial the wine is, meaning that people have different opinions on this one.
- =favourite= is amount of people who marked this wine as favourite of the event.
- =outcast= is amount of people who marked this wine as outcast of the event.
- =price= is wine price in UAH.
- =QPR= is quality price ratio, calculated in as =100 * factorial(rms)/price=. The reason behind this totally unprofessional formula is simple. At some point you have to pay more and more to get a little fraction of satisfaction. Factorial used in this formula rewards scores close to the upper bound 120 times more than scores close to the lower bound.

While not particularly fond of Bencze wines, I wanted the 'welcome' wine to be crisp and light. Its purpose is to wash away the weight of the long day and prepare us for a wine-tasting event.

Besides, its production is quite curious. First of all, it's a white wine made of Pinot Noir. Noir, Carl!

It's a reminder that most wine grapes have light-coloured juice (with a few notable exceptions). Red wines get their colour from the skins. And what happens when you remove skins? Blanc de noirs! White wine from dark grapes. It's a popular technique in Champagne but is used less often for still wines.

Secondly, it spent some time under the flor-like veil. For some reason, this yeast film fascinates me every time encounter it.

The grapes were gently pressed in whole bunches, and the must was poured directly into 228-litre French barrels. After fermentation, István Bencze filled the barrels somewhat 95%. The wine spent nine months on the lees without moving them, and a yeast film formed on the surface. István bottled the wine at the end of August of the following year without added sulphur, unclarified and unfiltered.

There are few viticultural regions as dramatic, wild, and diverse as Ribeira Sacra. Being a boundary between the cool, rainy Atlantic coast and Spain's hot, dry interior, Ribeira Sacra enjoys the best and the worst of the two domains. The main threats to viticulture are the storms that blow in from the Atlantic, bringing plenty of rain and wind; and morning fogs. A paradise for fungus. And yet people grow vines and make wines here. Some locals even practice organic and biodynamic farming. And that's truly heroic.

Among them is Iago Garrido. Due to constant rain and humidity, mildew growth becomes almost uncontrollable in the region. As a result, vineyards require more frequent copper and sulfur treatments compared to other drier wine regions. The majority of the vineyards where Iago works are inaccessible by machines, therefore, most of the work is done by hand. This inaccessibility also motivates growers to use chemicals as manual labor is too expensive if the wines cannot be sold for a price to offset the extra cost. Despite these challenges, Iago sticks to organic farming with biodynamic practices.

In 2014, Iago released his first wine called Ollos de Roque (Eyes of Roque). He produced two versions of it; a commercial variant and an experimental one called Número Dous (Number Two in Galician), which he kept for private use. The former was aged in oak barrels, while the latter was vinified in buried amphorae and aged under the influence of flor. Initially, Iago thought that using amphorae was a mistake, so he decided to sell the oak version. However, his friends started to tell him how much they liked Número Dous, and Iago also found the same pleasure in this wine.

Número Dous provided Iago with a clear path, and what was a mere accident to avoid in the future became the central focus of the entire range. Nowadays, all his wines have varying levels of flor influence (even red wines).

The Mercenario range of wines is made from fruit that has been purchased or sourced from vineyards that are farmed by Iago, but not owned by him. Iago follows organic or biodynamic practices in the vineyards he works with, while some vineyards are a mix of organic and conventional depending on the grower. Only grapes from exceptional sites are accepted from conventional growers, and they make up a very small proportion of the overall fruit. Additionally, Iago is constantly encouraging the growers he works with to switch to organic farming methods.

Mercenario Blanco is crafted by blending four grape varieties: Treixadura, Albariño, Torrontés, and Palomino. The primary source of grapes for this wine is the Manolo de Traveso vineyard, known for its clay-rich soil and granite bedrock, situated among some of the highest vineyards in the Miño River Valley. Additionally, a portion of the Treixadura grapes is sourced from the decomposed granite vineyard in the Arnoia Valley, while the Albariño grapes hail from the lower Miño area in Filgueira. Smaller vineyard parcels can also be found scattered across the three valleys: Arnoia, Avia, and Miño.

The primary fermentation starts in stainless steel with low temperatures. After fermentation, they are transferred to an equal mixture of 400-litre amphoras and 600-litre stainless steel tanks for around ten months of ageing.

We are in Haro, the mythical capital of the Rioja Alta region. Its ascension to a prestigious winemaking region was ignited by phylloxera. A curious insect, brought by accident from North America to Europe, devasted vineyards across the continent. The Great French Wine Blight drove many winemakers to alternative regions. The French settled in Rioja because they found potential there.

Rioja, like many other regions, has seen its ups and downs, reflecting Spain's history. Though, having potential is not enough. The wine doesn't make itself. Don Rafael López de Heredia y Landeta was an enthusiastic student when French negociants visited Rioja in search of alternative grape sources. He followed their footsteps and fell in love with Haro as he saw potential in the combination of soil and climate. Around 1877 he began the design and construction of the complex, known today as the López de Heredia bodega, the oldest in Haro and one of the first three houses in the Rioja region.

López de Heredia is famous for being true to their heritage and house style. Unprecedented old-school wine, a time machine trapped in a bottle. Today, María José López de Heredia runs the bodega. She says "tradition" doesn't mean immobility or opposition to change. The world and nature follow their own rhythm. So they need to be flexible while maintaining eternal principles and criteria.

To talk in our bodega of white wines being exclusively young and uncomplicated, would be asking for trouble.

Viña Gravonia is 100% Viura from 24 ha plots at 340 meters above sea level in the Gravonia vineyard near the banks of the river Ebro. Historically these wines were called Viña Zaconia. The average age of vines is 45 years. The whole plot is planted only with Viura grapes.

#+begin_quote
To María José López de Heredia, Gravonia has to be very fresh with citrus freshness and some nuttiness but without the bitterness of the aged Tondonia, which they compare with the Carbonieux and such wines from Graves.
