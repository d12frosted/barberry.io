Some people have to spend a lot of time until they find a path to their favourite craft. Daniele Delaini, a descendant of one of the largest growers of Bardolino in the past, changed several jobs until he 'returned' to his abandoned family estate. After a stink in banking and an attempt to sell Italian wines in Paris, he returned to Villa Calicantus, which he inherited from his aunt. The name of the estate comes after her favourite flowering plant.

Daniele started with one hectare of vines around the villa. But the inherited estate was abandoned for many years, and its cellar required complete renovation. And so, in 2011, Daniele was forced to make his first vintage in a nearby garage.

Let's be honest, Bardolino's reputation is quite questionable. For many years many farmers and winemakers were focused on quantity over quality. This resulted in flabby, soulless, and low-quality wines destined to be consumed by unfortunate tourists. Of course, I am exaggerating, but this descent sculped the face of this region.

Villa Calicantus was not operational during the times of industrial and chemical boom that happened in this region. So the nearly forty-year gap in his family's involvement in Bardolino played a crucial role in Daniele's philosophy.

#+begin_quote
Our goal is to bring Bardolino back on the map of great Italian wines, through a rediscovery of the true identity of wine with enormous potential.

Today Villa Calicantus owns 8 hectares of vineyards on some of the highest sites in the appellation. As they say, exceptional wine is made in vineyards, so Daniele farmed organically since day one. In 2014 he started the conversion to biodynamics. Each wine comes from only one specific area. Each wine tells a story of a specific vintage, a specific vineyard from a specific sub-area of Bardolino.

In the cellar, nothing is added except for little doses of sulfur. Wine is fermented with indigenous grape yeasts, decanted and bottled following the lunar cycles, not filtered, and not clarified.

And you know me. I love to start every evening with a glass of sparkling wine. [[barberry:/wines/9a0906be-1274-4820-918e-faf4bf0ec802][Sollazzo]] (Enjoy the sun) is a rosé sparkling made of Corvina, Rondinella, Molinara, and Sangiovese. Sounds interesting to me.

Sometimes people who sell wine decide to try on a new role of a vine grower or even a winemaker. Éric Chevalier was a négociant with ten years of experience when he moved to his hometown of Saint-Philbert de Grandlieu, just southwest of Nantes. Next year, in 2006, he ended up taking over the family Domaine. His father, a vigneron, had stopped working the vineyards, and Éric was faced with a difficult choice. Despite being anything but enthusiastic, he decided against replanting or selling vineyards. And instead, he decided not only to continue farming the Domaine but also to produce and bottle all of the family's result of hard work.

In 2020 Éric Chevalier acquired organic certification, a rare achievement in Loire Valley. Especially considering the difficult climate and love for high yields. In addition, Éric Chevalier is one of the few people still planting and producing wines from Fié Gris.

We continue to discover new wine grapes. This time we have a macerated Sauvignon Gris (or Fié Gris), which is a pink-coloured clonal mutation of Sauvignon Blanc. One could wonder why it has ‘Gris’ as part of its name. You might also recall Pinot Gris (commonly known as Pinot Grigio). But in reality, it’s called so according to the darker greyish fruit skin colour, in contrast to ‘Blanc’ fruit skin colour of Sauvignon Blanc. That’s right, ‘Gris’ means ‘grey’.

It’s also worth noting that wines made exclusively from Sauvignon Gris are rare, as it results in less aromatic wines and usually more smokey perfume. In addition, [[barberry:/wines/38b023df-8c26-45e1-80f7-6be3f53681cc][Cirrus]] have spent 3 to 4 weeks in contact with grape skin, and then was aged for 11 to 12 months on lees... Interesting, isn't it?
