This time I decided to gather people for a mixed bag blind tasting. Of course, I could call it ‘WINES FROM PLANET EARTH’, but it’s not helpful at all. Right? The thing is that I have lots of wines I want to share with people. Some bottles speak in liquid poems. Others tell stories through labels and the people behind them. And you know, my backpack holds up to 12 bottles, and usually, it’s a mixed bag of tasty stuff. So let’s open it.

How to read this table:

- =amean= is arithmetic mean (and not 'amen'), calculated as sum of all scores divided by count of scores for particular wine. It is more useful than =total=, because some wines are not tasted by all participants.
- =rms= is root mean square or quadratic mean. The problem with arithmetic mean is that it is very sensitive to deviations and extreme values in data sets, meaning that even single 5 or 1 might 'drastically' affect the score. Without deeper explanation, RMS is picked because it is bigger than or equal to average, because it basically includes standard deviation.
- =sdev= is standard deviation. The bigger this value the more controversial the wine is, meaning that people have different opinions on this one.
- =favourite= is amount of people who marked this wine as favourite of the event.
- =outcast= is amount of people who marked this wine as outcast of the event.
- =price= is wine price in UAH.
- =QPR= is quality price ratio, calculated in as =100 * factorial(rms)/price=. The reason behind this totally unprofessional formula is simple. At some point you have to pay more and more to get a little fraction of satisfaction. Factorial used in this formula rewards scores close to the upper bound 120 times more than scores close to the lower bound.

Some people have to spend a lot of time until they find a path to their favourite craft. Daniele Delaini, a descendant of one of the largest growers of Bardolino in the past, changed several jobs until he 'returned' to his abandoned family estate. After a stink in banking and an attempt to sell Italian wines in Paris, he returned to Villa Calicantus, which he inherited from his aunt. The name of the estate comes after her favourite flowering plant.

Daniele started with one hectare of vines around the villa. But the inherited estate was abandoned for many years, and its cellar required complete renovation. And so, in 2011, Daniele was forced to make his first vintage in a nearby garage.

Let's be honest, Bardolino's reputation is quite questionable. For many years many farmers and winemakers were focused on quantity over quality. This resulted in flabby, soulless, and low-quality wines destined to be consumed by unfortunate tourists. Of course, I am exaggerating, but this descent sculped the face of this region.

Villa Calicantus was not operational during the times of industrial and chemical boom that happened in this region. So the nearly forty-year gap in his family's involvement in Bardolino played a crucial role in Daniele's philosophy.

#+begin_quote
Our goal is to bring Bardolino back on the map of great Italian wines, through a rediscovery of the true identity of wine with enormous potential.

#+end_quote

Today Villa Calicantus owns 8 hectares of vineyards on some of the highest sites in the appellation. As they say, exceptional wine is made in vineyards, so Daniele farmed organically since day one. In 2014 he started the conversion to biodynamics. Each wine comes from only one specific area. Each wine tells a story of a specific vintage, a specific vineyard from a specific sub-area of Bardolino.

In the cellar, nothing is added except for little doses of sulfur. Wine is fermented with indigenous grape yeasts, decanted and bottled following the lunar cycles, not filtered, and not clarified.

And you know me. I love to start every evening with a glass of sparkling wine. [[barberry:/wines/9a0906be-1274-4820-918e-faf4bf0ec802][Sollazzo]] (Enjoy the sun) is a rosé sparkling made of Corvina, Rondinella, Molinara, and Sangiovese. Sounds interesting to me.

Patrick Sullivan works with his wife Megan in Yarra Valley to produce authentic wines on their farm in the Strezleki ranges, Baw Baw Shire, Gippsland, Australia. Patrick portrays himself as a farmer and not a winemaker. His vines are pure, intriguing and honest. His labels are catchy. Just take a closer look!

#+begin_quote
I do not put myself in the category of Natural Wines. I only make wine. Natural Wine is a constructed term that I do not like very much. I make wine in the way I like it and in the style that I like to drink and I do not feel better than someone who acidifies or uses selected yeasts. I do not do it because I do not like it. I do it differently.

Unlike Daniele Delaini, Patrick's path to winemaking began at a young age. Some say that at age of 12, he spent time planting vines during the school break. His personal site says that his first vinous "whiff" came whilst climbing the hills on a farm his family once owned. In any case, this initial spark developed into fascination and determination. So after finishing high school, Patrick spent two years travelling in Europe to learn winemaking techniques. His love for the craft only grew, so once he returned to his homeland, he studied botany and actuarial science. After post-graduate, Patrick wanted to learn from somebody. And so he went on to gain invaluable experience by working alongside respected winemakers (such as Stuart Proud, William Downie, Anna Martens and Eric Narioo) in various organically and biodynamically managed vineyards in Victoria.

After some time, he gained enough experience, knowledge and confidence to start own projects.

[[barberry:/wines/b34b4714-7bf8-4a52-b0e5-1774e035a4ae][Rain Field Blend]] is made of 30-40 years old vines. The Cabernet Franc is fermented using carbonic maceration and the Pinot Gris is fermented on skins in stainless steel for one month. All wines are then transferred to puncheon to settle out and come together.

Sometimes people who sell wine decide to try on a new role of a vine grower or even a winemaker. Éric Chevalier was a négociant with ten years of experience when he moved to his hometown of Saint-Philbert de Grandlieu, just southwest of Nantes. Next year, in 2006, he ended up taking over the family Domaine. His father, a vigneron, had stopped working the vineyards, and Éric was faced with a difficult choice. Despite being anything but enthusiastic, he decided against replanting or selling vineyards. And instead, he decided not only to continue farming the Domaine but also to produce and bottle all of the family's result of hard work.

In 2020 Éric Chevalier acquired organic certification, a rare achievement in Loire Valley. Especially considering the difficult climate and love for high yields. In addition, Éric Chevalier is one of the few people still planting and producing wines from Fié Gris.

We continue to discover new wine grapes. This time we have a macerated Sauvignon Gris (or Fié Gris), which is a pink-coloured clonal mutation of Sauvignon Blanc. One could wonder why it has ‘Gris’ as part of its name. You might also recall Pinot Gris (commonly known as Pinot Grigio). But in reality, it’s called so according to the darker greyish fruit skin colour, in contrast to ‘Blanc’ fruit skin colour of Sauvignon Blanc. That’s right, ‘Gris’ means ‘grey’.

It’s also worth noting that wines made exclusively from Sauvignon Gris are rare, as it results in less aromatic wines and usually more smokey perfume. In addition, [[barberry:/wines/38b023df-8c26-45e1-80f7-6be3f53681cc][Cirrus]] have spent 3 to 4 weeks in contact with grape skin, and then was aged for 11 to 12 months on lees... Interesting, isn't it?
