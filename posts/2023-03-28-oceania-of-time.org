Almost every event of ours begins with a welcome drink. But usually, we don't talk too much about welcome drinks. And I rarely mention them in our reports. There is nothing special about this Prosecco except for its name.

It's a well-known fact that Prosecco is a protected name reserved for sparkling wines from northeastern Italy. But before becoming a toponym and a designated appellation in 2009, Prosecco was a grape. Seeing how this name quickly turned into a brand, winemakers from Friuli-Venezia Giulia and Veneto desired to protect it from outside usage. Some say it was to monopolise the growing market. Some say it was to protect consumers and the brand from low-quality wines. What was the genuine reason? Who knows.

The only problem was one of nomenclature. Fundamentally, wine appellations are geographically designated areas tied to place rather than grape varieties. Italian Prosecco wines had long been made from grapes widely recognised by the name Prosecco, making the term itself fair game for producers globally. Luckily for Italians, there was a tiny Italian-Slovenian border town of Prosecco. So overnight, Prosecco ceased to describe a grape variety and instead described a style of sparkling wine and a region. And for the grape, they decided to use a fairly esoteric synonym for the same variety - Glera.

Since becoming a protected geographical designation, Prosecco became a hurdle in bilateral free trade negotiations between Australia and the European Union. Even today, it is still [[https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-01-20/eu-tells-australia-don-t-name-products-feta-and-prosecco?sref=vIMBelW3][a striking point]]. After-the-fact rebranding of Prosecco as a region rather than a grape is something of a rug pull. Australian winemakers have produced wines from the Prosecco /grape/ since 2001. The grape was brought to Australia in the late 1990s by the Dal Zotto family of Valdobbiadene. It quickly became popular in the local market. Today Prosecco grapes fetch [[https://www.agw.org.au/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/AGW_Australian-Prosecco-fact-sheet_visual-1.pdf][the second-highest prices]] of all white wine grapes. At the end of 2021, [[https://www.agw.org.au/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/AGW_Australian-Prosecco-fact-sheet_visual-1.pdf][the sales value reached]] more than AUD 200 million (more than USD 130 million).

In the past, I feared you would become tired of Adelaide Hills or Gippsland. But after spending so much time together drinking wine from these regions, it seems like we just crave more wines from these regions. Easy, I am here to help.

Patrick Sullivan works with his wife Megan in Yarra Valley to produce authentic wines on their farm in the Strezleki ranges, Baw Baw Shire, Gippsland, Australia. Patrick portrays himself as a farmer and not a winemaker. His vines are pure, intriguing and honest. His labels are catchy. Don't believe me? Just take a closer look!

I do not put myself in the category of Natural Wines. I only make wine. Natural Wine is a constructed term that I do not like very much. I make wine in the way I like it and in the style that I like to drink and I do not feel better than someone who acidifies or uses selected yeasts. I do not do it because I do not like it. I do it differently.

Patrick's path to winemaking began at a young age. Some say that at age of 12, he spent time planting vines during the school break. His personal site says that his first vinous "whiff" came whilst climbing the hills on a farm his family once owned. In any case, this initial spark developed into fascination and determination. So after finishing high school, Patrick spent two years travelling in Europe to learn winemaking techniques. His love for the craft only grew, so once he returned to his homeland, he studied botany and actuarial science. After post-graduate, Patrick wanted to learn from somebody. And so he went on to gain invaluable experience by working alongside respected winemakers (such as Stuart Proud, William Downie, Anna Martens and Eric Narioo) in various organically and biodynamically managed vineyards in Victoria.

After some time, he gained enough experience, knowledge and confidence to start own projects.

The 2020 season was the first of three very wet winters, which were followed by wet springs and, at this time, two mild summers. Though yields have been low, they've delivered some very detailed, precise and complex wines, which is no small achievement. There's no doubt that these wines are the product of the extraordinarily long ripening periods we've experienced in recent times and though the 2020 harvest was extremely small – with tiny quantities of wine being made – both Megan and I are very proud of this release and know that you'll find plenty to love too.

Baw Baw Shire is made of 100% Chardonnay from 40 years old vines of Bull Swamp vineyard on volcanic soils. The hand-harvested grapes are gently pressed by a pneumatic press. Juice is left to settle, then racked off its lees into barrels to ferment. Alcoholic fermentation takes two weeks, followed by malolactic fermentation in barrels. The wine spends 12 months in French oak barrels, 30% of which is new oak.

Kindeli wines are the product of Alex Craighead and Josefina Venturino. Alex, born in Australia and raised in New Zealand, studied wine and soon after began to travel the world to gain experience from other winemakers in various regions. That's how he met Josefina, a landscape architect from Argentina. Eventually, they moved to New Zealand.

From day zero, they were experimenting with low intervention winemaking. In 2014 they released their first wines in Martinborough. In 2016 they moved to Nelson, where they bought an existing organic winery and vineyard. In other words, they moved from the southern part of the Northern Island to the northern part of the Southern Island. Are you confused? You shouldn't be.

On 4.5 hectares of clay soils in Upper Moutere, Alex and Josefina cultivate 14 various varieties. In addition, they lease another three vineyards totalling another 9.5 hectares.

Kindeli Otoño is a blend of Gewürztraminer (50%), Riesling (50%), and Pinot Gris (10%). Gewurztraminer was fermented on skins for five days in an amphora. After pressing, Riesling and Pinot Gris juice is added to the spent skins for a day. The wines are all blended together and age in an amphora for several months before being bottled, unfined, unfiltered, and without sulphur.

Ochota barrels began as a passion of Taras and Amber during their surf trip along the Mexican west coast in a Volkswagen campervan in late 2000. After visiting several amazing wineries and beautiful surf spots, they decided to make holistic wines back in their homeland in South Australia.

Unfortunately, after a long struggle with an auto-immune-related illness, Taras passed away on October 12th 2020. Amber continues working in the winery.

The impeccable disorder is 100% Pinot Noir from a late-ripening organic vineyard in Adelaide Hills. Grapes are handpicked and fermented as whole bunches, with a few of the stalks added back to the fermentation. The grapes undergo partial carbonic maceration. The wine is pressed into seasoned French oak barrels before being bottled unfined and unfiltered, with just a small amount of SO2.

Gareth and Rainbo Belton are the country's leading experts in seaweed. They caught the wine bug a few years ago. And now they run a winery making small batches of fun and creative wines with their friends in the Basket range. Aye, we are still in Adelaide Hills. But don't worry, we are in the loving hands of Gentle Folk. Their focus is mainly on Pinot Noir and Chardonnay, but as you can deduce, they also produce Shiraz.

The grapes for this wine come from the 3.3-ha Murdoch Hill vineyard in Oakbank, planted by Michael Downer in 1998 at 390 meters above sea level. Soils are predominantly sandy loam over medium clay subsoils, with varying levels of ironstone, quartz and schist. The Oakbank area is a little warmer than some of the pockets of the Hills where Gareth grows his Pinot Noir, making it the perfect place to grow spicy, slippery, peppery cool-climate Shiraz. It's made in the same way as the Pinot Noirs with 100% whole bunches and a quarter new oak.

John Duval is an international winemaking legend and Australian superstar. Before starting a private label, he was a winemaker at Barossa Valley winery Penfolds for 29 years (16 of them, he was a chief). John Duval is responsible for putting together Grange and his signature wine, the RWT.

For the last decade (or even more), Duval travelled around the globe producing high-quality wines in Europe, the North-West of the USA and Chile. But his heart is in the Barossa Valley. Hence his private label was born here in 2003.

Annexus Grenache is made from grapes sourced from 150+ years old low-yielding vines from Northern Barossa and Eden Valley. The wine is aged for a year in older hogsheads, so the oak impact is minimal. Only 250 cases produced.

How to read this table:

- =amean= is arithmetic mean (and not 'amen'), calculated as sum of all scores divided by count of scores for particular wine. It is more useful than =total=, because on some events some wines are not tasted by all participants.
- =rms= is root mean square or quadratic mean. The problem with arithmetic mean is that it is very sensitive to deviations and extreme values in data sets, meaning that even single 5 or 1 might 'drastically' affect the score. Without deeper explanation, RMS is picked because it is bigger than or equal to average, because it basically includes standard deviation.
- =sdev= is standard deviation. The bigger this value the more controversial the wine is, meaning that people have different opinions on this one.
- =favourite= is amount of people who marked this wine as favourite of the event.
- =outcast= is amount of people who marked this wine as outcast of the event.
- =price= is wine price in UAH.
- =QPR= is quality price ratio, calculated in as =100 * factorial(rms)/price=. The reason behind this totally unprofessional formula is simple. At some point you have to pay more and more to get a little fraction of satisfaction. Factorial used in this formula rewards scores close to the upper bound 120 times more than scores close to the lower bound.
