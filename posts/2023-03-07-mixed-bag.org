Yup, it's a traditional sparkling wine from Devon, England. And before you start asking too many questions, let me assure you that England is an emerging winemaking region. Yes, over the centuries, the English has gained a reputation as wine consumers. Apart from being affiliated with both obscenely large volumes of drunkenness and snobbish appreciation, they played and still play an important role in the wine world, including winemaking.

And imagine, the history of winemaking in this domain spans back to ancient Romans, who introduced locals to virtues of civilisation, including wine. Funny enough, it was possible thanks to climate anomalies as it happened during [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roman_Warm_Period][Roman Climatic Optimum]], a period with a relatively warm climate.

Why do I find it funny? Because the English climate was not well suited for vines. Would they go to such lengths to secure wine supply from France, Portugal and Spain (depending on the geopolitical situation) if they had their own wine 'industry'? My hunch - no, they would not. So all this long history is nice and games, but the wine produced in England didn't satisfy locals. Until the revival of viticulture in the 1970s onwards. So I find it funny because it is possibly helped by a rising local temperature due to global warming (another climate 'anomaly'), making many southern parts dry and warm enough to grow grapes of high quality.

Over time the English came from sweet wines to sparkling and dry still wines. According to [[https://winefolly.com/deep-dive/all-about-english-wine/][Wine Folly]] (not sure where this information actually comes from), 84% of all produced English wines are sparkling or still white. And it kind of makes senses if you think about it. Despite the climate change, England is still a cold climate country. And just like with Champagne, grapes are high in acidity. In such a situation, it is a good decision to produce traditional sparkling wines.

[[barberry:/producers/aed0fb5b-1db0-4897-b28b-fd39b2bded97][Lyme Bay Winery]] is located in Devon, South West corner of England. But the winery sources their grapes across the country, and in the case of Classic Cuvée, all grapes come from Crouch Valley Vineyard (Maldon, Essex).

The Classic Cuvée is a blend of Pinot Noir (81%) and Chardonnay (19%). The grapes are picked by hand and pressed whole-cluster. The fermentation started after a slow, cold and natural settle, partially in oak barriques (33%) and in stainless steel (67%). In the following spring, the wine is blended and bottled for the second fermentation. It remained on lees for a minimum of 24 months.

Guillaume d'Angerville, current owner of famous Le Domaine Marquis d'Angerville from Bourgogne, decided to create a new project in Jura after tasting a single bottle - Tissot’s Chardonnay Arbois Les Bruyères 2005.

#+begin_quote
I tasted this bottle blind in a restaurant in Paris that I often go to. I always tell the sommelier to give me something blind and the only rule is that it has to be outside Burgundy. When he brought me this wine, I said, 'You forgot the rule, you brought me a wine from Burgundy.' And he said, 'I am afraid you're wrong.'

I understand that now you want to taste this wine. But unfortunately, even 2017 is not available in Ukraine anymore. But I guess a bottle of Savagnin by Domaine du Pélican is a good alternative. Besides, it's 'Macération Pelliculaire'! I bet you are already excited about tasting macerated Savagnin but hold your horses.

Macération pelliculaire means pre-fermentation maceration. Numerous English sources online ([[https://oray-wine.com/en/what-does-maceration-pelliculaire-mean/][example]]) draw an equivalence between orange wines and Macération Pelliculaire, but it's a matter of definition of the former term. For example, [[https://fr-m-wikipedia-org.translate.goog/wiki/Mac%C3%A9ration_pelliculaire?_x_tr_sl=auto&_x_tr_tl=en&_x_tr_hl=en-US&_x_tr_pto=wapp][French Wikipedia]] (aye, a trustworthy source, but some other sources are similar in this) states that orange wine requires fermentation on skins. Without too many details, pre-fermentation maceration is used to enhance the wine with aromatics and colour but without tannin extraction (or at least minimal). Interestingly, tannin is more soluble in an alcoholic environment (citation needed). And the cooler this environment, the less tannin is extracted. And before fermentation, there is no alcohol. Bam!

So what's the point? Unlike Savagnin Ouillé we tasted almost a year ago, this specific Savagnin is slightly macerated before fermentation. And hence, more expressive. On the other hand, all sources ([[https://vervewine.com/products/domaine-du-pelican-arbois-savagnin-maceration-pelliculaire-2018][example]]) I found say it spent 10 days on skins, which puzzles me. Why? Because 10 days for pre-fermentation maceration sounds too much. Unless it's done in a cold environment to block fermentation. Unfortunately, there is no official technical information from the producer. In any case, 2018 is the first release of this wine. So our best course of action is to drink this wine. And figure out nuances with the help of our senses.

Those who drink with me know I am an average vin jaune enjoyer. Aside from drinking these marvellous wines, I love to spy on other people's reactions when they taste this style for the first time. Ivan Omelchenko rarely brings a bottle of vin jaune, so I figured to gather the subjects myself.

Vin jaune (literally, yellow wine) is a Jura white wine matured in a barrel under a film of yeast, known as the voile, on the wine's surface. The result is unique and hard to mistake. It's really better to taste it to decide which side of the love-hate relationship you are on. Bruised apple and nutty aromas mixed with maple syrup, caramel or even curry. Sharp and light on the palate. The result is similar to dry fino Jerez, but vin jaune is not fortified. In Jerez, the film is so thick that it creates a protective barrier that inhibits oxygen exposure. This phenomenon is referred to as biological ageing. In vin jaune, the yeast layer is often thinner and not totally hermetic. Hence the resulting wine is 'yellow'.

Yeast is a simple fungus. Give it some glucose - and in the presence of oxygen, the yeast will utilise glucose to produce large amounts of energy for the cell and some intermediates the cell needs to function. Take away the oxygen, and the cell will continue its metabolic functions (e.g. glycolysis), but it will rely on the reduction of acetaldehyde into ethanol to keep the metabolism going. Most of the yeast strains responsible for alcoholic fermentation in wine generally die off once all fermentable sugars have been consumed, leaving only the unfermentable pentose (what we call residual sugar in still wine). However, some strains can spontaneously transition to an oxidative mode, metabolising glycerol, alcohol, and volatile acids in wine. So instead of dying off into fine lees, they float on the surface of the wine and develop a waxy coating. They multiply and spread out across the surface, forming a continuous layer. Voilà! Voile!

For a voile to form, certain conditions must be met.

1. A specific alcohol range must be reached and/or maintained for the yeast to thrive. The flor yeast in Jerez requires from 14.5% to 16% abv, which is achieved by fortification. The voile requires slightly lower alcohol levels (13% to 15%), so there is no need for fortification in vin jaune.
2. A sufficient oxygen level is required. For vin jaune, grapes are fermented slowly and kept in small (228L) old oak casks. They are not topped up, so an air gap appears above the wine due to evaporation.
3. A cooler and wetter environment is preferred. In such conditions, the flor layer will generally be thicker and give more pronounced freshness and yeast-driven aromatics.

The voile typically takes two to three years to develop fully. During this time, the wine is exposed to slight levels of oxidation (in vin jaune, the film is not hermetic) that provoke chemical changes that produce acetaldehyde and the aroma compound of sotolon. These compounds contribute to the unique flavours and aromas associated with vin jaune. Acetaldehyde gives distinctive bruised apple and nutty aromas. Sotolon gives notes of maple syrup or caramel at low levels and exotic spice aromas like curry at higher concentrations.

The desired result is achieved in at least six years. After the allotted time, only about 62% of the original wine remains. The vin jaune is bottled in special squat bottles that hold 62 cl, called clavelins. Historically the bottle size alludes to the amount of wine left over after six years of ageing and evaporation.

Wow, that was a long ride. Let's relax like these little people in kindergarten. So sing with me. What is flor? Baby (aka oxygen), don't hurt me. Easy to remember, right? I reckon this joke is better than singing the same tune while pronouncing Vladyslav.

How to read this table:

- =amean= is arithmetic mean (and not 'amen'), calculated as sum of all scores divided by count of scores for particular wine. It is more useful than =total=, because on some events some wines are not tasted by all participants.
- =rms= is root mean square or quadratic mean. The problem with arithmetic mean is that it is very sensitive to deviations and extreme values in data sets, meaning that even single 5 or 1 might 'drastically' affect the score. Without deeper explanation, RMS is picked because it is bigger than or equal to average, because it basically includes standard deviation.
- =sdev= is standard deviation. The bigger this value the more controversial the wine is, meaning that people have different opinions on this one.
- =favourite= is amount of people who marked this wine as favourite of the event.
- =outcast= is amount of people who marked this wine as outcast of the event.
- =price= is wine price in UAH.
- =QPR= is quality price ratio, calculated in as =100 * factorial(rms)/price=. The reason behind this totally unprofessional formula is simple. At some point you have to pay more and more to get a little fraction of satisfaction. Factorial used in this formula rewards scores close to the upper bound 120 times more than scores close to the lower bound.
