Yup, it's a traditional sparkling wine from Devon, England. And before you start asking too many questions, let me assure you that England is an emerging winemaking region. Yes, over the centuries, the English has gained a reputation as wine consumers. Apart from being affiliated with both obscenely large volumes of drunkenness and snobbish appreciation, they played and still play an important role in the wine world, including winemaking.

And imagine, the history of winemaking in this domain spans back to ancient Romans, who introduced locals to virtues of civilisation, including wine. Funny enough, it was possible thanks to climate anomalies as it happened during [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roman_Warm_Period][Roman Climatic Optimum]], a period with a relatively warm climate.

Why do I find it funny? Because the English climate was not well suited for vines. Would they go to such lengths to secure wine supply from France, Portugal and Spain (depending on the geopolitical situation) if they had their own wine 'industry'? My hunch - no, they would not. So all this long history is nice and games, but the wine produced in England didn't satisfy locals. Until the revival of viticulture in the 1970s onwards. So I find it funny because it is possibly helped by a rising local temperature due to global warming (another climate 'anomaly'), making many southern parts dry and warm enough to grow grapes of high quality.

Over time the English came from sweet wines to sparkling and dry still wines. According to [[https://winefolly.com/deep-dive/all-about-english-wine/][Wine Folly]] (not sure where this information actually comes from), 84% of all produced English wines are sparkling or still white. And it kind of makes senses if you think about it. Despite the climate change, England is still a cold climate country. And just like with Champagne, grapes are high in acidity. In such a situation, it is a good decision to produce traditional sparkling wines.

[[barberry:/producers/aed0fb5b-1db0-4897-b28b-fd39b2bded97][Lyme Bay Winery]] is located in Devon, South West corner of England. But the winery sources their grapes across the country, and in the case of Classic Cuvée, all grapes come from Crouch Valley Vineyard (Maldon, Essex).

The Classic Cuvée is a blend of Pinot Noir (81%) and Chardonnay (19%). The grapes are picked by hand and pressed whole-cluster. The fermentation started after a slow, cold and natural settle, partially in oak barriques (33%) and in stainless steel (67%). In the following spring, the wine is blended and bottled for the second fermentation. It remained on lees for a minimum of 24 months.

Guillaume d'Angerville, current owner of famous Le Domaine Marquis d'Angerville from Bourgogne, decided to create a new project in Jura after tasting a single bottle - Tissot’s Chardonnay Arbois Les Bruyères 2005.

I tasted this bottle blind in a restaurant in Paris that I often go to. I always tell the sommelier to give me something blind and the only rule is that it has to be outside Burgundy. When he brought me this wine, I said, 'You forgot the rule, you brought me a wine from Burgundy.' And he said, 'I am afraid you're wrong.'

I understand that now you want to taste this wine. But unfortunately, even 2017 is not available in Ukraine anymore.

According to my notes, we haven't tasted Savagnin yet. Even though we had many bottles from Jura. So, of course, we have to give it a try. This Savagnin is made in a clean and non-oxidative style just to be our entry to the new world. It could be the first step of many...

How to read this table:

- =amean= is arithmetic mean (and not 'amen'), calculated as sum of all scores divided by count of scores for particular wine. It is more useful than =total=, because on some events some wines are not tasted by all participants.
- =rms= is root mean square or quadratic mean. The problem with arithmetic mean is that it is very sensitive to deviations and extreme values in data sets, meaning that even single 5 or 1 might 'drastically' affect the score. Without deeper explanation, RMS is picked because it is bigger than or equal to average, because it basically includes standard deviation.
- =sdev= is standard deviation. The bigger this value the more controversial the wine is, meaning that people have different opinions on this one.
- =favourite= is amount of people who marked this wine as favourite of the event.
- =outcast= is amount of people who marked this wine as outcast of the event.
- =price= is wine price in UAH.
- =QPR= is quality price ratio, calculated in as =100 * factorial(rms)/price=. The reason behind this totally unprofessional formula is simple. At some point you have to pay more and more to get a little fraction of satisfaction. Factorial used in this formula rewards scores close to the upper bound 120 times more than scores close to the lower bound.
