Tired after a long workday? Having a late-night snack while watching some war-related videos on YouTube? Playing Final Fantasy XIV? Maybe having a pleasant conversation with your significant other before falling asleep? The commonality between these scenes is the lack of mental and intellectual resources to analyse wine. And that's fine! Sometimes all you need is a simple yet good wine - a background for other activities, a final touch to make the context more voluminous and relaxed. Such wine mustn't steal your focus or drain your resources. And, of course, respect your budget!

I enjoy drinking wine. Usually, it's an intellectual activity. But I feel no shame in treating some wines as a regular drink. Because there are cases where sophisticated wine makes no sense. Luckily, we live in wonderful times when it comes to wine consumption. The production quality is rather high, the market is big and wide, and there are plenty of wines for a decent price (aye, that's subjective). So I strive to find wines with a high quality-to-price ratio and with a price as low as possible. That's a challenge, as I taste many mediocre wines along the way. But the quest is rewarding. And today, I want to share some of the wines I buy in considerable quantities. There are many more positions, but this one reflects my drinking mood over the last two months.

Important disclaimer. I specifically omitted wines that are not available in the shops today. Also, I wanted to include stores other than Good Wine.

How to read this table:

- =amean= is arithmetic mean (and not 'amen'), calculated as sum of all scores divided by count of scores for particular wine. It is more useful than =total=, because on some events some wines are not tasted by all participants.
- =sdev= is standard deviation. The bigger this value the more controversial the wine is, meaning that people have different opinions on this one.
- =favourite= is amount of people who marked this wine as favourite of the event.
- =outcast= is amount of people who marked this wine as outcast of the event.
- =price= is wine price in UAH.
- =QPR= is quality price ratio, calculated in as =100 * factorial(rms)/price=. The reason behind this totally unprofessional formula is simple. At some point you have to pay more and more to get a little fraction of satisfaction. Factorial used in this formula rewards scores close to the upper bound 120 times more than scores close to the lower bound.
