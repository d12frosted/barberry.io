When you google videos on the history of Moldova, you can find 'Why does Moldova exist?' among the top-ranked ones. Frankly, I don't have a comprehensive answer to this philosophical question. But almost every 'quick facts list about Moldova' I checked contains a bullet or two related to wines. They mention traditions backed by nature, production volumes, consumption per capita[fn:1] and the largest in the world wine cellar by number of bottles. Indeed, Mileștii Mici cellars hold around 1.5 million bottles[fn:2] (at least, they did in 2005). Do you know where is the second-largest wine cellar? Again, in Moldova! Cricova claims[fn:3] they store more than 1.2 million bottles. Why do they stash instead of drinking?  I don't know. It's another philosophical mystery to me. Yet these facts make my spidey sense tingle. Probably there is some connection between Moldovans and wines. Let's see.

How to read this table:

- =rms= is root mean square or quadratic mean. The problem with arithmetic mean is that it is very sensitive to deviations and extreme values in data sets, meaning that even single 5 or 1 might 'drastically' affect the score.
- =sdev= is standard deviation. The bigger this value the more controversial the wine is, meaning that people have different opinions on this one.
- =favourite= is amount of people who marked this wine as favourite of the event.
- =price= is wine price in UAH.
- =QPR= is quality price ratio, calculated in as =100 * factorial(rms)/price=. The reason behind this totally unprofessional formula is simple. At some point you have to pay more and more to get a little fraction of satisfaction. Factorial used in this formula rewards scores close to the upper bound 120 times more than scores close to the lower bound.

Moldova has much going for it: gentle rolling hills on the same latitude as Burgundy, varied and vine-friendly topography, and a climate tempered by the Black Sea.

Novak Winery is a winery founded in 2004 on the basis of the old enterprise from 1977 in the village of Tartaul, Cantemir district of the Republic of Moldova. The vineyards from which the wines are produced stretch over 30 hectares in IGP Valul lui Traian. The vineyards are planted with local and international varieties, and the winery pays more attention to older local varieties.

The Novak family made a considerable effort to plant a large area of vines with Alb de Onițcani. This grape was created by a group of researchers from the Chișinău Agrarian Institute and Moldovan Wine Research Institute "Vierul" in the 1960s. The authors are D. Verderevschi, C. Voitovici, and I. Naidenova; co-authors are V. Buimistru, T. Carcevscaia, P. Apruda, B. Smentina, and V. Ponomarcenco. Alb de Onițcani is a technical variety obtained from pollination of Gyulyabi Chil with Mixture of Pollen Pierrelle + Seyanets 244. The grape is resistant to cold, mould, rot and mildew. Ok, you definitely had to learn this information. Thanks for following me.

Alright, alright. Forget this nolifer's information. Except for its hard-to-pronounce name, Alb de Onițcani is known for its high acidity. This holds true especially when you plant it in colder regions (e.g. Codru). Because of this, most winemakers use Alb de Onițcani only in bulk production. But partially thanks to global warming, in 2016, Andrei Novak produced the first Alb de Onițcani on the market with no other grapes blended. It was made from vineyards planted in 2008-2009 in the village of Tartaul (Valul lui Traian, which is Southern Moldova).

Today we have a bottle of Alb de Onițcani from a newer line - 500 Litres Barrels. Each of the three wines in this line is aged for 10 months in barrles of 500 litres volume.
