Everything gets weird when autumn hits your doorstep. It seems that the weather can't decide what role to play. Should it be chilly, or should it be hot? Oh, rain is also an option, right? Luckily, I know a solution to bear with this weather - *almost red wines*. They can be rosé, or they can be light red. Oh, something in-between is also an option, right?

Right! So this is our plan for the evening.

How to read this table:

- =amean= is arithmetic mean (and not 'amen'), calculated as sum of all scores divided by count of scores for particular wine. It is more useful than =total=, because on some events some wines are not tasted by all participants.
- =sdev= is standard deviation. The bigger this value the more controversial the wine is, meaning that people have different opinions on this one.
- =favourite= is amount of people who marked this wine as favourite of the event.
- =outcast= is amount of people who marked this wine as outcast of the event.
- =price= is wine price in UAH.
- =QPR= is quality price ratio, calculated in as =100 * factorial(rms)/price=. The reason behind this totally unprofessional formula is simple. At some point you have to pay more and more to get a little fraction of satisfaction. Factorial used in this formula rewards scores close to the upper bound 120 times more than scores close to the lower bound.
