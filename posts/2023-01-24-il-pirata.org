The fact that my relations with Sicilian wines are special might be something obvious. But not many people know that it all started with Gulfi stand at the very first Kyiv Wine festival. When we met, I was already tired (e.g. drunk). I almost passed by, disgusted by my own weakness, when a Gulfi representative (apologies, I don't remember her name) stopped me and offered a glass of their wine. I looked at the representative welcoming face. I looked at the naked ass on the label. And I realised there are no reasons to reject this present from Dionysus. And even though I don't remember which wines I tasted exactly, the Gulfi imprint is what I took out of that overly drunk day.

It is worth mentioning that the naked ass on the label has a meaning. A meaning close enough to what one might think. Meet an ancient mosaic from Villa Romana del Casale located in Piazza Armerina in the province of Enna. This mosaic depicts Eros (Cupid) and Psyche (Beauty). According to the story, out of envy of Venus, they are forced to love each other in secret. But passion rarely goes unnoticed, and in their case, it found a physical manifestation (no puns) in the form of a daughter (no puns, seriously) they called Vulptas (literally meaning 'pleasure'), a goddess of sensual pleasures. And how does it connect to Gulfi? Sicily is Psyche, Gulfi is Eros, and their child is wine, a sensual pleasure.

Enough of food for your fantasies. Carjcanti is 100% Carricante from Vigna Campo, district of Passo Guastella Chiaramonte Gulfi (Ragusa province, just like the famous city of Vittoria). The vines grow at 420 meters above sea level on limestone clay soils. Grapes are fermented with direct pressing in stainless steel tanks and oak barrels (500 and 2500 litres).

Arianna Occhipinti is a winemaker from Vittoria who founded her own winery in 2004, bottled her first commercial vintage in 2006 and today works exclusively with estate fruit. She embraced winemaking thanks to her uncle, Guisto Occhipinti, proprietor of Vittoria's most famous winery, [[barberry:/producers/512e0678-4812-4cee-b090-911416bcc0e2][COS]]. At the age of 16 years, Arianna started to help him in the cellars. She loved this experience so much that her future connected to wine tightly.

After graduating from oenology school, Arianna started with only 1 hectare of abandoned vines attached to a family vacation house. Over the years, she acquired 25 hectares featuring only autochthonous varieties - 50% Frappato, 35% Nero d'Avola and 15% white varieties Albanello and Zibibbo. Almost all vines are young because Arianna planted them on her own. But she also added to her holdings 60 years old albarello-trained vines, which she initially rented.

SP68 is the name of the road that cuts through Arianna's original vineyard in Vittoria. This road has existed for hundreds of years already. And the wine acquired this name because Arianna sees wine as a journey.

It's a 60-40 blend of Zibibbo and Albanello from 15 years old vines growing on red sands and chalk soils. The fruits are destemmed and co-fermented with indigenous yeasts in concrete tanks with two weeks long maceration. After that, the wine ages for 6-8 months in concrete tanks.

Il FrappatoÂ stems from a dream which I had when I was a girl to make a wine that knows the land that I work, the air I breath and my own thoughts. It is bitter, bloody and elegant. That is and the Iblei Mountains. It is the wine that most resembles me, brave, original and rebellious. But not only. It has origins, for this it loves its roots and the past that it brings in; but, at the same time, it is able to fight to improve itself. It knows refinement without forgetting itself.

These days Arianna Occhipinti is famous as a biodynamic winemaker. There is zero irrigation in her vineyards in this hot, windy climate! To protect the vines, she grows cover crops (like fava beans) and other plants between every other row. Arianna tries to minimize intervention in the winemaking process.

Arianna is regarded as a symbol of success in the world of Biodynamic Farming and Natural Wine Making. She has remained committed to those principles while evolving from her originally more dogmatic outlook. Below is her response to importer Jules Dressner's question about her feeling about the term "natural wine":

#+begin_quote
I make natural wine, but this is a term I'm beginning to be less and less comfortable with, because its implications are very complicated. I really want to stress that my main goal is to make a good wine that reflects where it comes from, and for me the only way to successfully do this is to make the wine naturally. When I first started, people were just starting to talk about natural wine. It was very important to me to think about all these issues, and in those early years I definitely had a more militant attitude about it. Making natural wine was a mission, something worth fighting for. Now that I've grown up a little bit, the mission is making wine of terroir. You have to respect the vineyards, and nature in general. When I wake up in the morning, I want to feel free. Making this wine is my opportunity to feel free. So again, my goal is not to make natural wine, working this way is a process to make good wine.

Il Frappato is 100% Frappato from 40-years old vines growing on red sands and chalk soils. The grapes are destemmed and macerated for 30 days and then aged for 14 months in large 25hl Slavonian oak barrels.

After spending some time with Arianna Occhipinti, let's give a visit to her uncle, Guisto Occhipinti. Azienda Agricola COS was founded in 1980 by three friends: Giambattista Cilia, Giusto Occhipinti, and Cirino Strano. The name is just an acronym of their family names (in case you didn't notice). The trio is known for the transformation of Cerasuolo di Vittoria wine from DOC to DOCG level (the only one on the island), as their 2005 release was the first to bear the new designation.

COS started its adventure with biodynamic farming and neutral terracotta vases. In 2007 (after moving to a new location), they decided to get rid of all their oak barrels in favour of 150 huge amphoras.

So today, we have a bottle of Cerasuolo di Vittoria Classico made in those amphoras. A 60-40 blend of Nero d'Avola and Frappato growing at 230 meters above sea level on red soils of limestone-siliceous nature. The average age of vines is 25 years. Yet there is a strange thing that apparently can be explained by the outdated state of the site. According to their site, the wine was aged in Slavonian barrels. Where do they come from if COS got rid of all barrels? Mystery, isn't it? In any case, technical information is scarce, so I pity those who missed our tasting event.

Making wine on the slopes of Mount Etna is an intensely personal, profound and ongoing act of love.
#+end_quote

Mount Etna. Crazy winemaking region with its charm, elegance, beauty, and, most importantly, character. A place to visit, to fall in love with, and stay for the rest of your life. Some are just 'lucky' to be affiliated with Etna by the right of birth. Giuseppe Russo, a graduate of Humanities with a Diploma in piano, re-established the family winery in 2005 and dedicated it to the memory of the late father, Girolamo. Their vineyards cover 18 hectares, surrounded by hazelnut and olive groves.

San Lorenzo is set outside Randazzo on the lower slopes of the volcano, 700 to 800 meters above sea level. The contrada is named after the cult of St. Lawrence. The wine is a blend of Nerello Mascalese with a tiny bit of Nerello Cappuccio. The 70 to 100 years old vines grow on volcanic (who would guess?) and sandy soils rich in minerals. Spontaneously fermented with indigenous yeasts. Macerated for 15 days and aged for 18 months in used 2600L oak casks. A relatively tiny production, only 4000 bottles yearly.

How to read this table:

- =amean= is arithmetic mean (and not 'amen'), calculated as sum of all scores divided by count of scores for particular wine. It is more useful than =total=, because on some events some wines are not tasted by all participants.
- =sdev= is standard deviation. The bigger this value the more controversial the wine is, meaning that people have different opinions on this one.
- =favourite= is amount of people who marked this wine as favourite of the event.
- =outcast= is amount of people who marked this wine as outcast of the event.
- =price= is wine price in UAH.
- =QPR= is quality price ratio, calculated in as =100 * factorial(rms)/price=. The reason behind this totally unprofessional formula is simple. At some point you have to pay more and more to get a little fraction of satisfaction. Factorial used in this formula rewards scores close to the upper bound 120 times more than scores close to the lower bound.
