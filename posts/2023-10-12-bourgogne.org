Amidst the gentle curves of its rolling vineyards and the timeworn cobbles of its ancient villages, Burgundy has, for centuries, been synonymous with wine of unparalleled distinction. It was with a nod to this rich heritage that "люди люблять вино", a community of oenophiles, chose to dedicate their final event to this iconic wine region. In an atmosphere teeming with anticipation and camaraderie, [[https://instagram.com/imulianov][Vova Ulianov]] and [[https://t.me/MykolaWhat][Mykola Chobanu]], organizers behind the event, challenged attendees with a blind tasting, allowing the true essence of Burgundy to shine, unfettered by labels or preconceptions.

This was not just an evening for savouring the nuanced flavours of Burgundy's famed varietals. Throughout the event, attendees had the privilege of tasting eight handpicked wines: three robust Pinot Noirs, four delicate Chardonnays, and a singular, refreshing Aligoté. Each pour was an exploration, each aroma a revelation, with every bottle standing as a testament to the land and hands that crafted it. As glasses clinked and notes were fervently jotted down, it became evident that the true essence of "люди люблять вино" was not just in the appreciation of the drink, but in the shared experience of discovery and passion.

How to read this table:

- =rms= is root mean square or quadratic mean. The problem with arithmetic mean is that it is very sensitive to deviations and extreme values in data sets, meaning that even single 5 or 1 might 'drastically' affect the score.
- =sdev= is standard deviation. The bigger this value the more controversial the wine is, meaning that people have different opinions on this one.
- =favourite= is amount of people who marked this wine as favourite of the event.
- =outcast= is amount of people who marked this wine outcast of the event.
- =price= is wine price in UAH.
- =QPR= is quality price ratio, calculated in as =100 * factorial(rms)/price=. The reason behind this totally unprofessional formula is simple. At some point you have to pay more and more to get a little fraction of satisfaction. Factorial used in this formula rewards scores close to the upper bound 120 times more than scores close to the lower bound.

Approaching Yann Durieux for the first time, I held some reservations, anticipating a wild, perhaps unruly experience. The wine's nose was indeed a captivating ensemble; a delicate, floral bouquet graced by pomegranate, sour cherry, and earthy undertones. As it breathed, the floral notes ebbed, making way for a more primal, animalistic profile punctuated by cranberries.

The palate, however, posed a challenge. The tannins, evocative of coarse sandpaper, were uncompromisingly dry, contrasting the wine's inherent juiciness. Underneath this intense tannic structure, there were glimpses of delicacy, but they were overshadowed by the wine's youthful vigour. In conclusion, while the craftsmanship is evident, the wine feels prematurely opened, needing more time to harmonise its fierce tannins with its nuanced character.

The 2020 Emphase offers up a delicate bouquet graced predominantly by sweet red fruits. This lively aroma is further complemented by the floral notes of peonies, painting a fragrant picture of a blossoming orchard. The palate closely follows, evoking the velvety consistency of kissel, underscored by a subtle bitterness reminiscent of dogwood or other herbaceous bitters.

While the wine might lack profound complexity, it certainly captivates with its interesting character. There are a few rough edges, true, but they don't overshadow the wine's inherent pleasantness. A lingering aftertaste ensures its presence is remembered, though it might benefit from a touch more acidity. It was easy to discern the youthful vigour of this wine, making it distinguishable from the eccentricity often associated with Yann Durieux.

The Gevrey-Chambertin Meix-Bas 2013 by Pierre Naigeon reveals itself through a somewhat restrained bouquet. This hesitancy, however, merely piques the curiosity. Red fruits come to the forefront, followed by more elusive scents of blood and underbrush. Sipping it is a joyful affair: it bursts onto the palate with vivacity and a juiciness underpinned by delightful acidity, like indulging in a delectable candy. It's strikingly well-balanced with a velvety texture that flows seamlessly from sip to swallow. And just when you think it's done, it leaves behind a lingering aftertaste, reminding you of its depth and maturity. The wine's age is unmistakable, yet it carries its years with grace and allure.

- alcohol: 14
- sugar: 1
- price: 2250 UAH

The 2018 Saint-Aubin 1er Cru En Remilly by Domaine Derain carries with it the gentle touch of canned peach, complemented by a zesty hint reminiscent of a lemon tart with meringue. Yeasty undertones add a subtle richness to its aromatic profile. On the palate, it swathes the senses with a velvety texture, coming across as round and indulgently buttery. Its balance is commendable, walking that fine line with grace. While it doesn't boast a great complexity, there's a soft, approachable character to it. A bit on the delicate side, perhaps, but nonetheless a pleasant pour.

- location: Burgundy, France
- alcohol: 11.5
- sugar: 1
- price: 1090 UAH

The 2020 Bouzeron by François de Nicolay unfurls with an immediate punch, one that's vividly reminiscent of salted peanuts. This saltiness melds seamlessly with the mellow sweetness of yellow fruits, juxtaposed against the slightly tart backdrop of green apricots. A presumption arises: the absence of malolactic fermentation. There's a perceptible green edge to it, manifested not just in its taste, but also in its undercurrent of zesty citrus notes. All of this is underpinned by an assertive acidity. This is not a wine that seeks to play it safe, but its risks are calculated, revealing a creation that's been expertly crafted.

The La Soufrandière Pouilly-Vinzelles Cuvée Zen 2019 sweeps in with an evocative seaside aroma: seafood and shells intertwined with ripe yellow fruits. This maritime ambiance is complemented by the striking presence of flint and gunpowder, adding depth to its olfactory profile. On the palate, the wine presents itself as beautifully balanced and structurally sound. A hint of malolactic fermentation lends it a buttery character, enriched with nuanced notes of tarragon. As for the finish, it's not just long – it's eternal, continually evolving and beckoning for another sip.

The nose kicks off with the earthy blend of beeswax and walnut, before throwing in a curveball with hints of seafood. Taking a sip, there's buttery richness, a bit of green apricot's tartness, and the subtle char of toast. Its mineral backbone is a steady hand guiding you through these flavour twists and turns, ending on a sesame afternote. The balance? Almost spot on – and for a 2011, that's no small feat. It wraps up with a tropical nod of canned pineapple. And yes, I'm kicking myself for blindly rating such a posh wine so high. My wallet might not forgive me!

- grapes: Chardonnay
- appellation: Meursault AOC
- location: Burgundy, France
- alcohol: 13
- sugar: 2
- price: 2850 UAH

Upon first sip, this Meursault greets you with a promising trace of apple seeds and chalk, reminiscent of an orchard on a crisp morning. There's an undeniable charm to its acidity – it's vibrant and sharp. While the wine has a certain sophistication, it doesn't overdo it, maintaining an approachable and straightforward character. The palate unfolds with citrus, stone fruit, and an unexpected touch of tropical guava, all layered beneath undertones of cream and chamomile. It wraps up with a lingering aftertaste where quince and chalk take the limelight. Simple, yet effective. Just like the best of life's pleasures, isn't it?
