Recently I woke up and realised that the summer has come. And not because of the weather, no. Instead, I felt a sudden desire to swim. Some circumstances make respite on the shores of the Black Sea not the best option, so I figured out an alternative - the White Sea. In other words, a sea of white wines. Luckily for us, the Garage has a lovely beach we can visit. And any decent leisure demands convives, right? So here we are, preparing to step into refreshing waters.

Look, this year was quite active in terms of wine-tasting events. We are only halfway through the year, but we already had more tastings compared to the previous year. This fact pleases me. It pleases Bacchus. It should also please you. But one thing doesn't check. The list of countries we visited through the glass misses a few destinations. And the list of tastes grapes could benefit from new blood.

Yet I didn't want to focus solely on atypical places or grapes. Some of the bottles in my cellar turned into sirens. And being a simple man, I could not resist the temptation. One must be insane to refuse a bottle of 1er Cru from Pierre-Yves Colin-Morey or an older Chenin Blanc from the late Jacky Blot. It's a Mixed Bag, after all. And I am ready to open my bag. Watch my hands:

Pierre-Yves Colin is one of Burgundy's (and the wine world's) most iconic winemakers. After working as the winemaker at his father's domaine from 1994 to 2005, Pierre-Yves established his own domaine alongside his wife, Caroline Morey. And while they inherited quite a few vineyards from their families, Pierre-Yves had to prove himself before his father, Marc Colin, allowed him to take over the vineyard in Bâtard-Montrachet. Today, it's the only Grand Cru owned by Pierre-Yves Colin-Morey.

His fastidious farming (lutte raisonnée[fn:1]), incredible attention to detail, use of larger demi-muid barrels, and long elevage - all that makes each one of his bottlings a clear expression of its terroir and a study in mineral-driven Chardonnay. Unlike many locals, Pierre-Yves uses 350L barrels (instead of 225L) and also ages his wines for a longer period of 18 months (vs 12 months).

How to read this table:

- =rms= is root mean square or quadratic mean. The problem with arithmetic mean is that it is very sensitive to deviations and extreme values in data sets, meaning that even single 5 or 1 might 'drastically' affect the score.
- =sdev= is standard deviation. The bigger this value the more controversial the wine is, meaning that people have different opinions on this one.
- =favourite= is amount of people who marked this wine as favourite of the event.
- =outcast= is amount of people who marked this wine as outcast of the event.
- =price= is wine price in UAH.
- =QPR= is quality price ratio, calculated in as =100 * factorial(rms)/price=. The reason behind this totally unprofessional formula is simple. At some point you have to pay more and more to get a little fraction of satisfaction. Factorial used in this formula rewards scores close to the upper bound 120 times more than scores close to the lower bound.

[fn:1] Lutte raisonnée (literally 'reasoned struggle') is an approach to viticulture which permits the application of agrochemicals only when absolutely necessary and not as a matter of routine. Practically, that means no chemicals unless there is a high risk of losing harvest or vines altogether.
