When life gives you a bottle of Gravner Ribolla Anfora 2004, and a bottle of Radikon Ribola 2007, you put aside your game pad and log out from Final Fantasy XIV to gather with your buddies for a small and cozy wine tasting event. Both of the winemakers - Joško Gravner and Stanko Radikon - come from Friuli Collio (also known as Goriška Brda), a historical region located around Gorizia town. Both of them played key role in amber wine renaissance that started in the end of XX century in this exact region divided between Slovenia and Italy. What could possibly accompany these two legendary wines? Of course, some other legendary wines from surrounding regions. Hence, some amber stars:

1. Cantina Alchemica Lanthano Bianco 2013
2. Kmetija Štekar Rebula Prilo 2015
3. La Stoppa Ageno 2015
4. Radikon Ribolla 2007
5. Gravner Ribolla Anfora 2004

How to read this table:

- =amean= is arithmetic mean (and not 'amen'), calculated as sum of all scores divided by count of scores for particular wine. It is more useful than =total=, because some wines are not tasted by all participants.
- =rms= is root mean square or quadratic mean. The problem with arithmetic mean is that it is very sensitive to deviations and extreme values in data sets, meaning that even single 5 or 1 might 'drastically' affect the score. Without deeper explanation, RMS is picked because it is bigger than or equal to average, because it basically includes standard deviation.
- =sdev= is standard deviation. The bigger this value the more controversial the wine is, meaning that people have different opinions on this one.
- =loved= is amount of people who marked this wine as favourite.
- =price= is wine price in UAH.
- =QPR= is quality price ratio, calculated in as =100 * factorial(rms)/price=. The reason behind this totally unprofessional formula is simple. At some point you have to pay more and more to get a little fraction of satisfaction. Factorial used in this formula rewards scores close to the upper bound 120 times more than scores close to the lower bound.

Wine making in Slovenia was constrained by communist government and was in a bad shape until 1991 when Slovenia become independent. Put aside love for nationalization and suppression of individuality. Many farmers had vineyards located in Jugoslavija and Italy at the same time, because historical region around Oslavia was divided between different countries over the years. Sounds painfully familiar to many of us. Nevertheless, passionate winemakers did exchange their knowledge and experience over the border and some people were experimenting with amber wines even in 1988.

Janko Štekar is 'young' generation of macerated wine makers. He owns 5 ha of vineyards in Goriška Brda that are located on steep slopes, at an altitude of 180 m, with S and SW exposure. Janko Štekar uses cherry, acacia and chestnut instead of oak for vinification and tries to find the best combination of material and size for each wine he produces.

As many producers in Brda, Janko Štekar has a hotel that you can visit. And taste some wonderful wines together with their maker.

** La Stoppa Ageno 2015

La Stoppa is a legendary historic estate that was founded in 19th century by a lawyer named Giancarlo Ageno. Initially focused on Bordeaux varieties, nowadays its vineyards are occupied by local Barbera, Bonarda and Malvasia. Elena Pantaleoni, current owner of the estate, works closely with famous enologist Giulio Armani (that has his own side project called Denavolo) to craft wines expressive of place and grape. They are advocates of minimal intervention along with usage of huge Slavonian oak botti and used French barriques. Also they are farming organically since 1990's and in 2008 they even acquired proper certification.

So our protagonist was named after founder of La Stoppa and made in collaboration with Giulio Armani. 2015 vintage is rare and considered to be legendary among Kyiv amber wine connoisseurs.

Note. The image displays 2019 vintage. 2015 has different design.

** Radikon Ribolla 2007

#+END_EXPORT

- producer: Radikon
- name: Ribolla
- vintage: 2007
- grapes: Ribolla Gialla
- vines: 2 hectares of 30 years old vines (average, many much older)
- location: Oslavia
- maceration: around 3 months
- ageing: 4 years in 25/35 hl Slavonian casks on lees
- alcohol: 13
- sugar: 3.2
- price: 1690 UAH

Stanko Radikon is a legendary farmer and winemaker from a legendary region. He and his friends started period of renaissance for amber wines - white wines with extended skin maceration. But of course, in town of Oslavia it was called "Slovenian" or "Friuli" style - hand-harvesting, skin contact, large and older barrel fermentation without any temperature control, no added yeasts or enzymes, and little to no use of sulfur.

The vineyards were originally planted in the beginning of XX century by Stanko’s grandfather Franz Mikulus with the local favorite, the Ribolla Gialla grape. And basically, Stanko went back to the ways his grandfather was producing wines back in 30s.

After Stanko passing away in 2016, his son Saša took the winery in his hands. Though people say that nothing has really changed in the philosophy of Radikon winery as Saša has been helping out since he was a kid and a partner since 2006.

*On bottle size*. Stanko Radikon and Edi Kante were not happy about bottles of regular 0.75l volume. It's not enough for two people and too much for one person. That's why they designed bottles and corks of alternative size - 0.5l and 1.0l with corks that imitate wine to oxygen proportion of magnum bottles. First release that saw new bottles is 2002. Edi Kante likes to joke that 1.0l bottle is ideal for two people when only one is drinking.

*On ranges*. You might have noticed that some wines made by Radikon have blue label and some have purple label. In short, blue label is their 'traditional' and top-tier wines. This range started by Stanko himself and is now continued by his son Saša. The purple label is officially called S range (or Saša wines) and was crated by Saša to branch out a bit on his own and to produce entry level wines. They see a noticeably shorter maceration, 8 to 14 days versus 3 months. They are also ferment and age in smaller vessels and age for only 18 months before bottling. And yes, they are bottled in traditional 750ml bottles.

- producer: Gravner
- name: Ribolla Anfora
- vintage: 2004
- grapes: Ribolla Gialla
- location: Oslavia
- maceration: around 6 months
- ageing: 5 months in qvevri, 6 years in big Slavonian casks (20-50 hl)

Joško Gravner is considered to be father of macerated white wines trend. Before he produced his first amber wine, he was a promising star of modern and technological wine making scene. He confessed that he would purchase any new piece of equipment he could find. His life turned upside down after trip to California back in 1987. California was (and maybe still) a destination for many winemakers as this region represents triumph and possibilities of /new/. No wonders, as Californian wines won Judgement of Paris in 1976 and this event dramatically changed wine world. Joško Gravner was taking the same path as Californian wine makers - oak, science, additives and all that cool stuff. But after tasting 1000 wines in 10 days he was simply astonished by faceless and tasteless results. And he realised that this is the road to a dead end. Now he knew, how not to produce wines.

His searching lasted almost a decade. Basically he was studying history of wine making and was searching for a way to produce authentic wines that talk in language of land and history. Long story short, he found out that (a) his ancestors made skin contact wines here in Collio/Brda and (b) Georgia has a very long history of wine making (more than 8000 years) and they've been making skin contact wines for quite a long period.

In 1997 (after devastating 1996) he produced his first vintage of extensively macerated Ribolla. And after 3 years, when this vintage become ready, Gambero Rosso, Italian wine & food magazine that has huge influence on the industry, gave a devastating assessment of this new style. As result, 80% of 1997 Ribolla were returned to winery. Joško Gravner was crushed, but realised that this is actually the way to go.

In the same 2000, Joško Gravner visited Georgia and ordered 11 qvevri. Unfortunately only 2 of them were properly delivered to his winery. So he started to actually use qvevri for production only in 2001. And nowadays he owns more than 45 of them!

Interestingly, Ribolla and Breg (two wines produced by Joško Gravner) had a word 'Anfora' printed on the labels of 2001 vintage. However they were not 100% fermented in anfora till 2003. Even more, qvevri was not used for Breg Rosso production till 2005. And after some time, in 2007 they decided to remove this word from all labels as this information was redundant - all their wines where fermented in qvevri now.

And today wines produced by Joško Gravner are treated as the highest manifestation of skill. Many people consider his Ribolla the best orange wine in the world.
