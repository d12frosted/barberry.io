The name comes from three grapes used for this wine - 40% White Gamay (the former name of Chardonnay), 40% Poulsard and 20% Savagnin. The grapes are planted together as "complantées" - an old wine-growing method whereby a mixture of grape varieties are planted side by side in the same plot.

Southwest exposure on limestone Lias marls with some scree. Biodynamic vines inspected and certified by Demeter France since 2003: use of horn dung (500P), silica (501) and herbal tea treatments.

Slow pressing of the 3 grape varieties together. Fermentation and ageing in oak barrels with no added SO2, regular topping-up and bottling seven months after harvest on a "flower" day according to the lunar calendar.

Meet Gareth and Rainbo Belton, the country's leading experts in seaweed. They caught the wine bug a few years ago. And now they run a winery making small batches of fun and creative wines with their friends in the Basket range. Aye, we are still in Adelaide Hills. But don't worry, we are in the loving hands of Gentle Folk. Their focus is mainly on Pinot Noir and Chardonnay. And at last, we are going to taste their Piccadilly Chardonnay!

The grapes come from Udy's RD vineyard in the heart of Piccadilly where the wines are renowned for their power and flair. It's 1.4 hectares of Chardonnay vines planted in 1983. They enjoy west exposure on 525 meteres above the sea level growing on quartz rubble over siltstone, sandstone and clay.

Whole bunches crushed and pressed to tank for settling overnight before racking off solids to barrel. The wine spent eleven months in French and Austrian oak, 20% new. Bottled under DIAM cork, sealed with wax.

The history of winemaking in the North America is a tale of the shattered hopes of would-be wine-growers. When the early colonists first landed in North America, they were impressed by the lush vines whose fruit decorated the forests. Yet the wines made of these grapes were 'foxy' - the earthy muskiness was prevalent in the smell and flavour. Europeans didn't enjoy the result, so they decided to bring vines from their homelands. Yet they struggled and failed to grow European vines. The plants withered and died. Having no notion of what was killing their vines, the colonists assumed it was their fault and kept trying different varieties and methods.

Today we know that diseases and climate caused these troubles. Phylloxera, the deadliest enemy of European vines, riddled American soil. The hot, humid summers of the south and east encouraged diseases unknown in Europe. And in the north, imported vines died because of harsh winters. Yet native American vines developed resistance to all of these hazards.

Success came with accidental hybrids of Vitis vinifera (Europe's only vine species) and local Vitis labrusca. New vines were resistant, and the wines produced were less faulty. With this discovery, a new era in American winemaking started. But that's the story for another time.

La Garagista (one who makes wine in a garage) is located on Mount Hunger at the edge of the forest in the Châteauguay and in the Piedmont chain of hills in Barnard, Vermont, USA. It's a small homestead farming focused on vines, but they also grow vegetables, fruits, flowers, and herbs for personal consumption. Deirdre Heekin and Caleb Barber started the farm in 1999, yet the winery opened its doors in 2010 with the first vintage. They currently make around 34 distinct cuveés, including several ciders.

Don't be fooled by the name of Dolcetto. The name suggests that wines made of Dolcetto grape are light and probably sweet, but in reality, they are dark in colour with aromas of fruits, liquorice and tar and heavy tannin. The late Stefano Bellotti played a crucial role in the biodynamic movement in this region. It doesn't feel morally correct to copy-paste the story of Stefano Bellotti, so if you are curious, just read it on [[https://www.bowlerwine.com/producer/cascina-degli-ulivi][Bowler]] or [[https://louisdressner.com/producers/cascina%20degli%20ulivi][Louis/Dressner's]] websites.

Over 100 years old vines. The odd combo of grapes in this wine (Timorasso, Verdea, Bosco, Riesling, Chasselas) are all co-planted together in the Filagnotti vineyard. They existed well before Stefano started working this land in the 80's. No one knows why these grapes were chosen. The vines are planted in deep clay with iron oxide. Nine months of maceration on the skins in botti with a submerged cap. After a racking, the wine ages on its lees for another two months.

- чому 700+? рік врожаю бази - (мінус) 1272 🙂
- чому так рахує? я чесно не до кінця розумію
- десь чув фразу його - це просто жарт
- але типу його перше вино цієї лінійки - 728 було зроблене у 2000-ому році
- і він каже, що це 728-е вино, що зробили з часу заснування дому - 1898 року
- от тобі і 1272

Their own vineyards consist of 11 hectares in Côte de Blancs (Avize and Oiry) and 17 hectares in Vallée de la Marne (Aÿ, Dizy and Hautvillers), and they purchase grapes from another 8 hectares in those villages where they also have vineyards of their own.

How to read this table:

- =rms= is root mean square or quadratic mean. The problem with arithmetic mean is that it is very sensitive to deviations and extreme values in data sets, meaning that even single 5 or 1 might 'drastically' affect the score.
- =sdev= is standard deviation. The bigger this value the more controversial the wine is, meaning that people have different opinions on this one.
- =favourite= is amount of people who marked this wine as favourite of the event.
- =outcast= is amount of people who marked this wine as outcast of the event.
- =price= is wine price in UAH.
- =QPR= is quality price ratio, calculated in as =100 * factorial(rms)/price=. The reason behind this totally unprofessional formula is simple. At some point you have to pay more and more to get a little fraction of satisfaction. Factorial used in this formula rewards scores close to the upper bound 120 times more than scores close to the lower bound.
