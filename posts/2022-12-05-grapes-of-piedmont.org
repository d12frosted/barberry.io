A patchwork carpet spread over the hillsides of a beautiful country full of authentic character. Mostly known for Barolo, Barbaresco and Asti (yay, bubbles), now it is a home for wine world bandits that dig up old colours and senses. While I was preparing for [[barberry:/posts/2022-10-18-atypical][Atypical ver.1.22474487139...]], I realised how many little-known grapes Piedmont has to offer. Aside from well-known Nebbiolo, Barbera, Cortese and Moscato, there are less-known grapes like Arneis, Dolcetto, Grignolino, Freisa, Slarina, Brachetto, Uva Rara, Ruché, Pelaverga Piccolo. Of course, it's impossible to fit everything into one event, so today, we have a small subset of all the Piemontese diversity to have a small taste of local grapes.

If I had to select a single producer for this evening, it would be Cascina Tavijn. Not only because they have a wide enough portfolio; but also because I am in love with their rustic character and peasant authenticity. Of course, we could have started with Asti or Gavi, but to hell with those wines. It's time for some rebels with gorgeous labels made by Gianluca Cannizzo (the designer behind [[https://mypostersucks.com/][My Poster Sucks]]).

Cortese and Chardonnay from vines just beneath Nadia's home blended with a little Moscato from her friend Ezio Cerruti. The grapes were destemmed and macerated for a few days (4-7 days), fermented in steel and then racked to fibreglass for nine months.

Try asking around about Slarina. There are a handful of farmers that grow this almost extinct grape. Among them are Cascina Tavijn and Fabrizio Iuli. And I must say that Fabrizio is a very interesting person, especially in the context of the modern world, where the boundaries are saturated as well as traditions and authenticity. He comes from Montaldo di Cerrina, a small town with a population that dropped from 450+ souls to just 92 over the last decades. Yet Fabrizio stays in his hometown and does his best to keep the place alive and flourishing. He even started a school for kids that follows a Steiner-inspired Italian-English curriculum that embeds traditional academics in an outdoor classroom set in the vines, fields and woodland of the farm.

As the only winemaker in the town, he tries to make traditional Piemontese wines that are easy and fun to drink. The grapes found in his vineyards are Baratuciat (a nearly-extinct white variety from the Val di Susa), Grignolino, Nebbiolo, Pinot Nero, Barbera, and, of course, Slarina. La Rina comes from very young vines planted in 2013. Owning nearly a hectare and a half of it, he jokes, "I am the most important producer of Slarina in the world". It was macerated for ten days, fermented in cement vats and aged for 6-8 months (again, in cement vats). 5500 bottles produced. Quite a lot for a nearly-extinct grape.

I love walking in circles. I love getting back to the starting point. That's why we finish (no connection to the Fins) with Bandita - 100% Barbera from 40 years old vines scattered about the steep hills of the Monferrato. It spent two months on the skins, pressed to concrete vats for a year and then aged for one additional year in a big barrel.

The name of this wine comes from the fact that it was denominated from DOC and granted the most basic level - Vino Rosso, a table wine. And that's how the modern history of Piemontese wine-making is made.
