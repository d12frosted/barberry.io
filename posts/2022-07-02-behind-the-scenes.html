    <p>When I tell people that I need to prepare for a wine tasting event, some suspect me of drinking all day long just to select several bottles. Ah, if only it was true. But what happens in reality? I spend hours and hours reading, writing, consulting, and doubting my choices. To illustrate, this morning, I was a detective searching origins of the candidate for the upcoming event. I am talking about <a href="../wines/baf18c42-2e67-4108-967a-d540bc105779.html">Cascina Bertolotto Spumante Brut Metodo Classico NV</a>. Quite a strange selection. No, it has nothing to do with the wine itself. The reason is conflicting and unclear information about this wine scattered over the internet. So I had to figure out who was the actual producer of this wine.</p>
<p>According to the <a href="https://regno.ua">importer website</a>, Bertolotto Brut is a project run by Taso. Of course, I questioned the crazy mind that added the word ‘Brut’ to their winery name. But I also doubted the relationship between Taso and this wine. Why? Because Taso is not mentioned on the wine label at all.</p>
<p>So as a modern person, I googled ‘Bertolotto’. And luckily, I found some companies related to the door business. Wait, of course, I am looking for wine! And so I landed on the <a href="https://cascinabertolotto.com/">Cascina Bertolotto website</a>. It turned out they produce <a href="https://cascinabertolotto.com/prodotto/brut-di-bertolotto/">Metodo Classico V.S.Q. “Bertolotto” Cuvée Brut</a>, but its label is different.</p>
<p>Aside from the winery name, technical information from the importer’s website matches information from Cascina Bertolotto’s website. And then, somewhere in the internet cache, I found that Cascina Bertolotto’s website hosted an image of a different label - one I have. Bingo!</p>
<p>Funny, though. Because according to the producer’s website, this wine spent 12 years on the lees. But arithmetic is a brutal bitch. The label says that it was disgorged in January 2017. This means it spent on the lees 8 years at most. And since you have to finish the first fermentation before your sparkling is sent on its sparkling quest, I guess the actual number is around 5-7 years. In addition, despite sharing vendemmia, some bottles are disgorged later than others. This gives a perfect opportunity to study little differences.</p>
<p>Alright, so now you know how I spend my Saturday mornings. A bottle of water, background music, and myriads of sites in different languages. Just to bring a story and appreciation of wine. And I enjoy it, even if it stays behind the scenes.</p>
