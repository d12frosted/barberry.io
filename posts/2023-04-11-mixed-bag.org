Tom's delicately salty entry-level orange, what a dream. Light as a feather so up into weightlessness.

It's tempting to say that [[barberry:/producers/cdc80e0e-1163-4b33-916d-e6806e5073e3][Matassa]] is a regular at our wine-tasting events. Yet according to my notes, it joined our parties only twice in the previous year, and this is the second appearance this year. Indeed, there are producers I forced you to drink more often. Curious to know their names? All the data is public.

There are two problems with [[barberry:/producers/cdc80e0e-1163-4b33-916d-e6806e5073e3][Matassa]]. On the one hand, I genuinely love their wines, so only a handful of them survives to appear in our tasting glasses. On the other hand, Matassa rarely stays on the shelves for a long time. And unlike other countries, you can buy as many bottles as you want in Ukraine. There is no limit at all! Crazy.

Olla Blanc 2021 is a blend of Muscat Blanc à Petit Grains and Macabeu. Yes, the Good Wine label says it's a blend of Grenache and Macabeu, yet I believe it's a mistake, considering the production technology. The vines grow at 600 meters above sea level on limestone with a high iron content. After spontaneous fermentation, the wine ages on sur lie in 2,000l concrete vats. How long did it spend on skins? Different sources diverge. [[https://louisdressner.com/wines?wine=VDF%20Blanc%20%22Coume%20de%20l%27Olla%22&prod=Matassa][Some say]] it had a two-week whole-cluster maceration. [[https://www.differentdrop.com/products/2021-matassa-olla-blanc][Others state]] it was only one week. Unfortunately, there are no official technical sheets. So let's trust our senses.

Just 10% of alcohol. A deliciously perfect start to the evening.

One of our regulars (and I am speaking about a real person here, not wine) was curious to taste a few classical examples of Chardonnay. Being a simple life form, I try to satisfy my fellow convives' requests. So here we are, with Domaine Pinson and Pierre-Yves Colin-Morey in a row.

To my limited experience with the region, this bottle is an excellent entry to the world of traditional Chablis. Compared to some other bottles I tasted from Domaine Pinson, this one is approachable with a typical profile despite some old oak.

In addition to being simple, I am also lazy. If you are curious about the Chablis region, you should just duckduckgo it. Yet I am a generous copy-paster, so let me explain why Chablis is so unique in one word. Terroir.

[[file:/images/2023-04-11-mixed-bag/2023-04-05-21-46-54-7h63r8.webp]]

Chablis has a unique soil formed by the recession of a prehistoric basin that once covered parts of northern France, including the eastern Loire, southern Champagne, and most notably, Chablis. The limestone-based soil (known as Kimmeridgian marl) is layered with fossils of ancient aquatic life.

Domaine Pinson farmed in Chablis since 1640. In 1940 they became one of the first properties in Chablis to sell directly to the public. Louis Pinson led the adoption of estate bottling. Today Charlène Pinson and her father Laurent run the domain. They own 14 sustainable-farmed hectares of the crème de la crème of Chablis terroir, with prime holdings in six premier crus and the grandest cru of them all, Les Clos.

Domaine Pinson Chablis 2020 comes from two parcels in the heart of Chablis: one half from just below 1er Cru Mont de Milieu and another half from between 1er Cru Vaillons and 1er Cru Montmain. We are talking about 40+ years old Chardonnay vines growing on classic Kimmeridgian soil. Hand-harvested grapes. The wine spontaneously ferments and ages in stainless steel. I've heard some people talking about minimal oak influence, but I could not find a trustworthy source to state this.

Off we go to a different part of Burgundy - Saint-Aubin, Côte de Beaune (southern part of Côte d'Or). And we also have an upgrade - a 1er Cru by Pierre-Yves Colin, one of Burgundy's (and the wine world's) most iconic winemakers.

After working as the winemaker at his father's domaine from 1994 to 2005, Pierre-Yves established his own domaine alongside his wife, Caroline Morey. And while they inherited quite a few vineyards from their families, Pierre-Yves had to prove himself before his father, Marc Colin, allowed him to take over the vineyard in Bâtard-Montrachet. Today, it's the only Grand Cru owned by Pierre-Yves Colin-Morey.

His fastidious farming (lutte raisonnée[fn:1]), incredible attention to detail, use of larger demi-muid barrels, and long elevage - all that makes each one of his bottlings a clear expression of its terroir and a study in mineral-driven Chardonnay. Unlike many locals, Pierre-Yves uses 350L barrels (instead of 225L) and also ages his wines for a longer period of 18 months (vs 12 months).

[fn:1] Lutte raisonnée (literally 'reasoned struggle') is an approach to viticulture which permits the application of agrochemicals only when absolutely necessary and not as a matter of routine. Practically, that means no chemicals unless there is a high risk of losing harvest or vines altogether.

I reckon we need something to reset our senses. One might say that the earth exploded, leaving myriads of tiny islands between Greece and Turkey. Samos, a largely mountainous island, is almost touching Anatolia, only separated from it by 1 mile (sic!) Mycale Strait. In 2017 [[barberry:/producers/985badd4-6e4e-471e-a7f2-f2ec646f1b1a][Jason Ligas]] and [[barberry:/producers/a693b9c2-b4f7-4f79-ab0a-85b4fd91af0f][Patrick Bouju]] created a collaborative wine project Sous Le Végétal (under vegetation), on this beautiful green island. Through the variety of Muscat de Samos grapes, they try to express the spirit of the local terroir.

Jason Ligas is more known by his own [[barberry:/producers/985badd4-6e4e-471e-a7f2-f2ec646f1b1a][Ktima Ligas]] from Pella in northern Greece. Just 61 days ago, we tasted [[barberry:/wines/6d64366b-03ab-40e9-be42-29b47b5ba98a][Spira 2019]], one of his creations, at [[barberry:/posts/2022-07-28-mixed-bag][another Mixed Bag event]]. It was a bonus bottle. I bet many of you remember this beauty.

Another star of Sous Le Végétal, [[barberry:/producers/a693b9c2-b4f7-4f79-ab0a-85b4fd91af0f][Patrick Bouju]], comes from Auvergne, France, where he owns [[barberry:/producers/a693b9c2-b4f7-4f79-ab0a-85b4fd91af0f][Domaine la Bohéme]]. We have not tasted their wines as part of Barberry Garden, but some of you suffered this experience with me (either in the office or on the offsites).

What you usually notice while looking at Sous Le Végétal bottles is the off-the-Earth labels created by Anthony Duchene, a French artist inspired by the volcanic granite soils.

Hüpnos (sleep in Greek) is 100% Muscat de Samos (aka Muscat Blanc à Petits Grains) from Karvounis and Agïi Sarandides. The vines grow on volcanic soils. One-half of the grapes are macerated on skins for 40 days and aged in stockinger barrels. All other grapes are pressed by their own weight (kudos to gravity), aka "free-run juicy", and aged in stainless steel tanks.

How to read this table:

- =rms= is root mean square or quadratic mean. The problem with arithmetic mean is that it is very sensitive to deviations and extreme values in data sets, meaning that even single 5 or 1 might 'drastically' affect the score. Without deeper explanation, RMS is picked because it is bigger than or equal to average, because it basically includes standard deviation.
- =sdev= is standard deviation. The bigger this value the more controversial the wine is, meaning that people have different opinions on this one.
- =favourite= is amount of people who marked this wine as favourite of the event.
- =outcast= is amount of people who marked this wine as outcast of the event.
- =price= is wine price in UAH.
- =QPR= is quality price ratio, calculated in as =100 * factorial(rms)/price=. The reason behind this totally unprofessional formula is simple. At some point you have to pay more and more to get a little fraction of satisfaction. Factorial used in this formula rewards scores close to the upper bound 120 times more than scores close to the lower bound.
