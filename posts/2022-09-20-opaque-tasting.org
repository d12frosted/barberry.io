We sometimes forget how important color and temperature are in assessing wines.

A (professional) sensory analysis of wine breaks it down using eyes, nose, and mouth. We often focus more on the smell and the taste of a particular wine, not talking much about its visuals. Yet, the sight reveals a lot of information about wine: its grape varietal, the region it comes from, some of the winemaking aspects, and its age. Our brain perceives this information even if we don't acknowledge it, or even if we don't know its meaning. Aside from removing the last source of subjective judgement, what else would happen if we won't be able to see the wine? And if both red and white wines are served at room temperature in opaque glasses, would we be able to guess at least the colour? I've heard, from various sources, that it's not as easy as it seems. So let's try!

Honestly, I feared that I would not be able to gather enough people for this format. On one hand, it's more nerdy and wine-focused than our usual events. On the other hand, glasses are pricey and are hard to find. Yet, we have enough people to taste 4 wines. Unfortunately, every person has only one glass, so we taste them sequentially, but in 'pairs'. Meaning, we taste the first two wines, vote, reveal, and then repeat with the second pair.

We start with a classical pair - a delicate Pinot Noir and oaked Chardonnay, both from Burgundy. Then we have a more slippery combination - light Cariñena from South Africa and white Châteauneuf du Pape. And as a bonus, for the brave mood, we have a jokingly tricky mix of macerated Pinot Gris from Alsace (even the colour is deceiving) and a light rosé from Umbria.

A land of small vineyards owned by peasant farmers who eat in three-star restaurants, ride on luxury cars, do the dirty work on the vineyards and winery and sell the most expensive wines in the world. Burgundy is a complex and highly detailed region containing about a third of wine appellations in France. Land that qualifies for one of Burgundy's better appellations is so valuable that it rarely passes out of the family. Often it becomes part of a complex inheritance system which requires all property to be shared equally among the children. As a result, the whole region is a carpet made of incredibly small scraps.

Domaine Rossignol-Trapet was established through the alliance of two families. The Rossignols were winemakers since the 16th century in Volnay. The Trapets - since the 18th century in Gevrey-Chambertin. Domaine owns 14 ha of old vineyards in the renowned villages of Beaune, Savigny-les-Beaune and Gevrey-Chambertin. Most of them are Pinot Noir, and only 0.7 ha are Chardonnay.

Nicolas and David Rossignol have been running the Domaine since the 1990s. They produce sophisticated, gorgeous and elegant wines. In my inexperienced taste, Domaine Rossignol-Trapet is among the best Pinot Noir producers you can find in Ukraine.

Les Bas Liards comes from 35-years old vines in Savigny-Les-Beaune, Côte de Beaune (southern part of famous Côte d'Or, or Golden Slope). Hand-picked, sorted and destemmed, it is fermented in barrels. Around 10% of oak is new.

I picked Les Bas Liards for this evening because its elegant, even feminine, palate might trick you considering our setting. In hopes to create a wow effect and to confuse you even further, I decided to place it before the oaked Chardonnay.

Côte d'Or often comes to mind when you talk about Burgundy. But let's not forget that besides this golden mine, Burgundy has other wonderful regions to offer, including Chablis and Mâconnais. The latter is the home of Jean-Paul and Jean-Guillaume Bret. These brothers set up the project in 2001, intending to produce terroir wines from selected plots. Their formula is dead simple. Every wine is made of grapes from a single plot of 40+ years old vines from a single farmer. Yup, unlike their other project, La Soufrandière, they buy grapes for Bret Brothers wines.

Today they produce around 50,000 bottles in 14 different cuvées, around 8 ha. It includes grapes sourced from Beaujolais (Brouilly, Lantignié, Chénas and Juliénas). This expansion happened in 2013.

Climat La Colonge comes from a 0.35 ha plot of 35 years old vines from the Pouilly-Loché appellation (the smallest of Mâconnais). Though the real age of the vines is unclear because, unlike the website, the label talks about 45 years. Anyway, vines grow at 200 meters elevation on clay and limestone soils. 100% vinified and aged in oak barrels (228 litres each) for 11 months. 100% malolactic fermented. 2627 bottles produced.

And what can be more confusing than an oaked and MLF-ed Chardonnay served at room temperature in a black glass?

Here comes the tricky part, an experiment of mine. Follow Your Dreams is a very light expression of Cariñena from Swartland, South Africa. It has plenty of red fruits in it, yet I hope the white Châteauneuf du Pape would outweigh Testalonga's creation.

We already had some wines by Testalonga as part of Barberry Garden events, so you can read more about them on a separate page. Yet, few words about the wine of the evening. Planted in 2001, bush vine, farmed organically. Bunch fermented. The fruit is crushed before going into the tank for 12 days of fermentation and then pressed off into two old 3500L foudre and 500L barrels. A light clarifying filtration, no fining.
