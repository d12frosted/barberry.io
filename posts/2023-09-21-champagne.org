How to read this table:

- =rms= is root mean square or quadratic mean. The problem with arithmetic mean is that it is very sensitive to deviations and extreme values in data sets, meaning that even single 5 or 1 might 'drastically' affect the score.
- =sdev= is standard deviation. The bigger this value the more controversial the wine is, meaning that people have different opinions on this one.
- =favourite= is amount of people who marked this wine as favourite of the event.
- =outcast= is amount of people who marked this wine outcast of the event.
- =price= is wine price in UAH.
- =QPR= is quality price ratio, calculated in as =100 * factorial(rms)/price=. The reason behind this totally unprofessional formula is simple. At some point you have to pay more and more to get a little fraction of satisfaction. Factorial used in this formula rewards scores close to the upper bound 120 times more than scores close to the lower bound.
