<p>Welcome to <strong>Barberry Garden</strong>, a place where we drink wine and talk about wine.</p>
<p>Independent (self-funded) website focused on the wine world. How are wines grown and made? Who is making them? Where and since when? And even how do they taste and why? I am no sommelier and am not affiliated with any wine importer or store. I am just a casual who loves to drink, take notes and tinker with Emacs.</p>
<p>This site is still under development. So most of the planned features are not available yet. Check out the latest <a href="/posts/2022-09-15-site-updates.html">Site Updates</a> article to learn about the development process.</p>
